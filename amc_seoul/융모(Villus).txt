This is a structure to increase the surface area for absorbing nutrients at the absorptive column of the small intestine, located on the inner mucosal folds of the colon. Intestinal juice secreted by the absorptive column aids in the digestion of food. It exists in the inner walls of the small and large intestines and also during pregnancy in the placenta. The length of the villi is about 1mm, encasing protrusions that come from the mucosal layer. Inside the villi are a capillary network and a lymphatic vessel. The surface area of the villi is more than 100 times greater than the surface area of the human body, making it a suitable structure for absorbing nutrients and water. The exposed absorptive columns of the small intestine have circular folds, villi on the surface of the folds, and microvilli located at the edges of the villi, increasing the surface area for digestion by about 60 times. Numerous villi and microvilli play a role in maximizing the area available for nutrient absorption in a given space, expanding the contact area with food to effectively absorb nutrients. The interior of the villi contains a capillary network and lymphatic vessels to transport absorbed nutrients. Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed through the capillaries of the villi, some through the portal vein, while the rest circulates in the blood, and fat-soluble nutrients are absorbed through the lymphatic vessels within the villi and circulate in the blood. Villi in the placenta attach to the uterus, supplying oxygen and nutrients and providing them to the fetus through the umbilical cord. Villi membrane test During weeks 9-12 of pregnancy, after confirming the fetus and placental location using ultrasound, a portion of the villi membrane is detached through the cervix for examination. The collected villi membrane is analyzed for chromosomal nuclear forms to determine any fetal abnormalities.
