Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete collagen and mucopolysaccharides, which are the raw materials of osteoid, to create bone tissue. Eventually, they mineralize with calcium phosphate to become bone. Some osteoblasts are embedded in the osteoid they create, becoming osteocytes. As one ages, there is a tendency for the number of osteoblasts to decrease, which is associated with osteoporosis. They are located on the inside of the periosteum that surrounds the bone. These cells have a cuboidal or rounded shape with nuclei generally large and round, and their cytoplasm is strongly basophilic. When synthetic ability decreases, the cells may become flattened or weakened, and they no longer differentiate. Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete proteins internally and transport the synthesized organic molecules to the surface of bone cells. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) secreted by osteoblasts stimulates bone formation, promoting calcium attachment to the bone surface. Osteoblastoma is a benign tumor that creates osteoid tissue from osteoblasts and rarely occurs. It typically appears in individuals aged 20 to 40, with sizes ranging from 2cm to 6cm, and the exact cause is unknown. Patients usually experience pain for a few months, accompanied by swelling at the site of the tumor. Treatment involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. According to a study in Germany, regular exercise for two years in menopausal women with decreased bone density led to reduced spinal and pelvic bone loss, decreased cholesterol levels, improved back pain, and enhanced physical strength.
