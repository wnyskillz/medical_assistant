The esophagus is relatively straight compared to other organs, and through peristaltic movement, it pushes food upwards and downwards, preventing food reflux as it has upper and lower sphincter muscles. It connects to the pharynx at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra and to the stomach at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophageal wall consists of mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer, and outer layer. About one-third of the esophagus is made up of striated muscle, while the lower two-thirds are made up of smooth muscle. The upper and lower parts of the esophagus have sphincter muscles to prevent food from refluxing. The esophagus has a normal physiologic constriction in the upper part passing through the cricoid cartilage, the part compressed by the trachea, and the part penetrating the diaphragm. The esophagus plays a role in moving food that enters the pharynx through peristaltic movements upwards. The ends of the esophagus are closed by muscles called sphincters. When food enters the pharynx, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes to accept the food. Then, the sphincter closes immediately to prevent the food from refluxing. As food travels down the esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow the food to enter the stomach upwards. Afterwards, the lower esophageal sphincter closes to prevent contents from the stomach from refluxing back into the esophagus. If there is a problem with the lower esophageal sphincter and acidic contents from the stomach reflux into the esophagus, it can cause damage and inflammation of the esophageal wall, leading to gastroesophageal reflux disease.
