It is located between the placenta and the fetus within the fetal membrane in the uterus of a pregnant woman. The umbilical cord is formed at the time when the fetus is 5 weeks old from the amnion and yolk sac to supply nutrients to the fetus. It has a gelatinous substance called Wharton's jelly, with two arteries and one vein twisted in the center. The umbilical cord does not have nerve tissue, so cutting the umbilical cord does not cause pain. Through the umbilical cord, the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother and excretes carbon dioxide and waste. One large umbilical vein sends nutrient- and oxygen-rich blood to the fetus, while two small umbilical arteries send the fetusâ€™s blood containing carbon dioxide and waste to the placenta. After birth, when the umbilical cord is exposed to the external environment, the flow of placental blood back to the newborn stops, and the umbilical cord's pulse ceases. When the baby is born, cut the umbilical cord about 4cm away from the abdomen, tie it with a cord clamp about 2cm away from the belly button, and it will dry up and fall off on its own over time, leaving the belly button. The umbilical cord usually falls off around 7 to 10 days after birth. During this time, it is disinfected with 70% alcohol without covering it with gauze or cotton, and allowed to air dry naturally. Even after the umbilical cord falls off, it is recommended to continue disinfecting for about 15 days, and it is safe to give a sponge bath from 3 to 4 days after the umbilical cord falls off. If there is a foul smell from the belly button, it is slimy or secreting, the skin turns red, or a pea-sized lump appears in the belly button area, it is advisable to seek medical attention.
