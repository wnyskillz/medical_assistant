The choroid is one of the eye walls located between the sclera and the retina, and it is a thin membrane rich in blood vessels and melanin cells at the back of the eye. It plays a role in preventing incoming light from scattering, acting as the choroid at the back of the eye and the iris at the front. It is located between the sclera on the outside and the retina on the inside at the back of the eye. The choroid is a thin membrane with abundant blood vessels and melanin pigment located in the middle of the eye wall, composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. Of these, the choroid occupies the back of the eye, while the ciliary body and iris are located at the front. The choroid is a thin layer of 0.3 to 0.5mm thick, dark in color due to the abundance of melanin cells. The inner surface of the choroid is closely attached to the pigment layer of the retina, but the outer surface is loosely connected to the sclera. The part connected to the optic nerve at the back of the eye does not contain the choroid. The abundant melanin pigment in the choroid blocks external light, prevents incoming light from scattering, and the richly distributed blood vessels supply nutrients to the retina. Wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet rays during outdoor activities can help prevent choroidal damage. Regular eye examinations once a year can be used to examine the choroid. Eye examinations include visual acuity tests, refraction tests, intraocular pressure tests, and fundus examinations, and in particular, diseases such as choroidal melanoma can be confirmed through fundus examinations. Even if the examination results are normal, it is recommended to have an eye examination every 2 to 3 years for early detection of diseases.
