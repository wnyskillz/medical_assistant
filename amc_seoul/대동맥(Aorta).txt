It is composed of three layers of walls: the inner intima, the mostly muscular media, and the outer adventitia. The aorta connects to the heart, traverses the chest and abdomen, and branches out to peripheral blood vessels. The aorta ascends in an arch shape from the left ventricle of the heart and then descends downward. Its structure is strong to withstand the powerful contracting force of the heart pumping blood. The thickness of the vessel wall consists of three layers: intima, media made of muscle, and adventitia. At the connection point with the left ventricle, there are three semilunar leaflets forming the aortic valve. After leaving the heart, the aorta ascends upwards before forming an arch shape downward, known as the aortic arch. The aorta is divided into the ascending aorta, which goes towards the head, and the descending aorta, which goes downwards. The part of the aorta located above the diaphragm muscle, which divides the chest and abdomen, is called the thoracic aorta. It passes the aortic arch and forms branches to the left subclavian artery, bronchi, etc., as it descends below. The portion below the diaphragm muscle is called the abdominal aorta, which further branches into the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. The abdominal aorta extends to the lower abdomen and divides into the common iliac arteries. The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and carries oxygen-rich blood directly from the heart to the whole body. The aortic valve, located at the beginning of the aorta from the left ventricle, prevents blood from flowing back into the heart. Aneurysm is a localized dilation of an artery and is usually caused by weakening of the artery wall, often associated with aging and atherosclerosis. Aortic aneurysms mostly occur in the abdominal aorta. They may grow without obvious symptoms until they become as large as an adult's fist. Aneurysms are often likened to balloons that can burst suddenly. If an aneurysm in the abdominal aorta ruptures, it can lead to internal bleeding and may result in death. Aging is a natural process that brings changes to our bodies as we grow older. Blood vessels also age, but the symptoms may not appear until later, so it is important to be cautious. Many people are aware of the aging of blood vessels but continue unhealthy habits like smoking and lack of exercise, which can harm the blood vessels. Instead of struggling with treatment after a disease occurs, it is better to prevent aneurysms by adopting healthy habits like quitting smoking and regular exercise from now on to maintain vascular health.
