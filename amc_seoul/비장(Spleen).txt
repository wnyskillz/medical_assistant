The spleen aids in the function of immune cells, filters out bacteria and antigens in our body, and removes aging red blood cells. It is located where the left ribs end, behind the stomach and above, attached to the back. The spleen is about 12cm long and weighs around 200g, shaped like a flattened oval and covered by a thin membrane. It consists of the cortex, red pulp, white pulp, arteries, and veins. The red pulp of the spleen helps regulate and maintain the quality of red blood cells by removing senescent red blood cells from the bloodstream. The white pulp synthesizes antibodies to maintain our body's immune function and filters out bacteria and antigens in our body. Furthermore, the spleen helps in producing blood cells when the bone marrow function is compromised. When infections or inflammation occur in our body, the spleen's role becomes more significant and its size can increase. However, if the underlying condition is treated, the spleen can regain its normal size and function. Patients who have undergone a splenectomy should be cautious of infections and receive appropriate vaccinations after consulting with their healthcare provider.
