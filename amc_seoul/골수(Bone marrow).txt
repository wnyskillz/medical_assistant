By logging in, you can enjoy even more benefits. Located in the inner space of bones, it is a soft tissue that generates blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Marrow can be divided into red marrow and yellow marrow depending on the proportion of constituent cells. It exists in the inner space of bones. The main structures of the marrow are trabecular bone and blood vessels, hematopoietic cells, and stromal cells surrounding hematopoietic cells. Unlike other organs, the types of constituent cells in the marrow are diverse, and there is no specific pattern in cell arrangement. Only based on trabecular bone and blood vessels, it is referred to as the endosteum and perivascular area. The blood vessels of the marrow are connected by nutrient arteries, arterioles, sinusoidal capillaries-venous sinuses, collecting venules, and postcapillary venules, among which the sinusoidal capillaries-venous sinuses are pathways through which marrow hematopoietic cells exit to the peripheral blood. The marrow functions as a hematopoietic organ that produces blood cells such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, making approximately 2 billion red blood cells/kg, 7 billion platelets/kg, and 0.85 billion granulocytes/kg per day. If there is a problem with the marrow, the white blood cells responsible for immunity may lose their function, leading to an extremely dangerous state even with minor skin damage or exposure to bacteria. In cases where there are issues with the marrow, a method of treatment involves transplanting healthy marrow collected from a matching donor, referred to as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or marrow transplantation. Unlike other organ transplants that involve major surgery opening the abdomen or chest, marrow transplantation is similar to receiving a blood transfusion and involves a relatively simple process.
