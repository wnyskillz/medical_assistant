It corresponds to the facial nerve, which is the fifth of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves, and is involved in the sensation of the face and chewing movements. It is located on the outer side of the brain. It is the largest cranial nerve, composed of large sensory fibers and small motor fibers. Fibers from the trigeminal nerve branch out into three parts leading to the face, called the ophthalmic nerve, maxillary nerve, and mandibular nerve. The ophthalmic nerve at the top emerges from the trigeminal ganglion of the maxillary and mandibular nerves and interacts with various nerves. The maxillary nerve in the middle is a larger sensory nerve than the ophthalmic nerve and exits through the foramen rotundum and the skull. The mandibular nerve at the bottom is the largest branch of the trigeminal nerve, with mostly motor fibers in the front but also a small sensory branch forming the mylohyoid nerve. The back of the mandibular nerve is sensory and responsible for the sensation of the teeth. The sensory nerves transmit sensory information (touch, pressure, pain) from the facial skin, nose, and oral mucosa to the brain, while the motor nerves activate the jaw muscles to enable chewing. Damage to the trigeminal nerve can lead to trigeminal neuralgia, causing sudden facial pain attacks. Pain can occur when sensory nerves are stimulated or motor nerves are involved, typically during eating, shaving, exposure to mild wind on the face, or exposure to cold temperatures. Pain and attacks at the distribution of the trigeminal nerve are referred to as trigeminal neuralgia. In comparison to trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal neuropathy presents with more pronounced sensory loss and less pain. Pain in trigeminal neuralgia usually occurs on one side and originates from one or two of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve. The most common cause of trigeminal neuralgia is nerve compression by blood vessels, with a tendency to occur more frequently in women. Treatment methods for trigeminal neuralgia include medication, nerve blocks, and neurosurgical procedures, tailored to the individual patient.
