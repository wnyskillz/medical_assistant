The peritoneum is a serous membrane that follows the abdominal cavity, covering most of the internal organs within the abdominal cavity with a thin connective tissue layer. The peritoneum supports various organs in the abdomen and functions like a sheath through which numerous nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels pass. The peritoneum surrounds the abdominal cavity as connective tissue, located in all organs of the human body such as the abdominal wall and pelvis. The peritoneum is made up of a thin epithelium and underlying adhesive connective tissue, forming two layers that surround the entire abdominal cavity. The part covering the inner wall of the abdomen is called the parietal peritoneum, while the part covering the surface of the internal organs is called the visceral peritoneum. The peritoneum located some distance away from the internal organs forms the mesentery that connects to the internal organs, and blood vessels supplying the internal organs are enclosed within the mesentery and covered by the visceral peritoneum. In particular, parts of the small and large intestines are located in the retroperitoneum outside of the peritoneum. Recently, surgeries on organs located deep in the retroperitoneum are also performed through endoscopy instead of laparoscopy. Within the abdominal cavity, there is a transparent fluid called peritoneal fluid, which allows organs to move without causing friction between them. The peritoneum is composed of very thin epithelial cells and connective tissue, serving to protect and prevent adhesions between the internal organs in the abdominal cavity. It also produces lubricating fluid to prevent adhesions between the digestive organs, allowing the organs to move synchronously. The internal organs in the abdominal cavity can move smoothly within the abdominal cavity, allowing some degree of change in their positions. Unlike hemodialysis, which removes blood outside the body, peritoneal dialysis involves injecting dialysis fluid into the abdominal cavity through a catheter inserted in the lower abdomen. The peritoneum, a membrane forming the abdominal cavity, is a semipermeable membrane that allows water and solutes to pass through, serving as a filter to cleanse the blood. In patients with end-stage renal disease with no kidney function, waste and excess fluid in the body are removed using peritoneal dialysis instead of kidney function. There are two methods of performing peritoneal dialysis. Automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) is done by visiting a hospital, where a machine injects and drains a predetermined amount of dialysis fluid while the patient rests. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) involves the patient independently exchanging dialysate in the abdominal cavity through a catheter inserted in the abdomen, allowing for dialysis to be performed at home. It takes approximately 30-45 minutes and is done 3-4 times a day. During the 4-6 hours when dialysis fluid is in the abdomen, the patient can move freely. Patients can adjust the dialysis amount slightly, allowing relatively freedom in meals and fluid intake, but there is a risk of peritonitis during frequent dialysate exchanges. Paracentesis is the removal of accumulated fluid in the peritoneum by inserting a catheter in the abdomen and draining the fluid out.
