Most nephrons are located in the renal cortex, with some positioned at the junction of the cortex and the medulla. Each kidney contains over a million nephrons. The nephron consists of the renal corpuscle, tubules, and collecting ducts. The tubule is long and thin, closed at one end, and folded to form a cup-like structure with two layers of membranes. The cup-shaped structure surrounding the glomerulus, a cluster of capillaries connected to the renal artery, is called Bowman's capsule. Bowman's capsule and the initial part of the tubule, called the proximal convoluted tubule, are located in the renal cortex. The proximal convoluted tubule extends toward the medulla in a U-shape, connecting to the loop of Henle and then passing through the distal convoluted tubule towards the collecting duct, renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra.

Nephrons are divided into cortical nephrons and juxtamedullary nephrons based on their location. Cortical nephrons have their renal corpuscles positioned in the outer layer of the cortex with shorter loop of Henle, comprising about 80% of all nephrons. Juxtamedullary nephrons have their renal corpuscles located at the boundary between the cortex and the medulla, with the loop of Henle extending deep into the medulla along with the collecting duct. They make up about 20% of all nephrons. Filtration occurs as blood passes from the vessels into the nephron, and nutrients, water, electrolytes, and waste are selectively reabsorbed or excreted along the tubules until urine is eventually produced and expelled through the collecting duct.

Cortical nephrons may not have the loop of Henle extending deep into the medulla or may lack the loop altogether, therefore not participating in water reabsorption and secretion. On the other hand, juxtamedullary nephrons regulate water reabsorption and control osmotic pressure within the medulla due to the loop of Henle extending deep into the medulla. Even with a decrease in kidney function of 35-50%, symptoms may not appear and blood test results may still indicate normal function because the remaining healthy nephrons can compensate for the damaged ones.
