Logging in provides access to a wider range of benefits. Temporary storage of produced urine is collected in the pocket-shaped portion in the kidney and is then expelled via the ureter into the bladder. Located inside the kidney, the calyx sits where the ureter begins. The central part of the kidney protrudes in a cone shape toward the renal pelvis that leads to the ureter, and this protrusion is called the renal papilla. There are about 7-10 renal papillae, each having multiple openings at their ends where urine produced in the kidney is discharged. The discharged urine flows into the minor calyx, which surrounds several papillae, for storage. Two to three minor calyces combine to form a major calyx, and two to three major calyces merge to connect to the ureter. Each kidney has around 8-12 minor calyces, and the inner cavities of the minor calyces are bulging like a funnel. By injecting contrast dye into the calyces, X-ray images can be taken to observe the shape of the renal pelvis or calyces, aiding in understanding any changes in the structure of the kidney or calyces and assessing kidney function and abnormalities. It is the part of the kidney where urine produced by the renal corpuscle and nephron is excreted. The urine generated from the renal papilla is collected in the minor calyx, then connected to the major calyx and expelled through the ureter. Renal stones form when substances in the urine crystallize and deposit, creating solid formations resembling stones. Stones that are small can pass out of the body naturally through urine, whereas larger stones can cause issues as they move through the kidney, ureter, bladder, and urethra, leading to complications. Stones may cause injuries to surrounding tissues resulting in hematuria. Large stones can block urine flow causing severe flank pain. Most kidney stones resolve on their own without specific treatment or can be managed with procedures like extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy without posing a threat to life. However, identifying the underlying cause of kidney stones is crucial as they can recur. Kidney stones can form depending on the concentration of certain substances, thus analyzing the composition of stones that are passed in the urine is essential for accurate prevention. Even if the cause is unknown, staying well-hydrated and adjusting the diet can help prevent stone formation.
