It is a large, flat, triangular bone on each side of the upper back that connects to the second through seventh ribs symmetrically and can be felt on the surface of the back. The front is concave and the back protrudes outward and upward, culminating in the acromion, which forms the peak of the shoulder. The scapula connects the torso to the arms and transmits power and movement. It is located symmetrically on each side of the upper back from the second to seventh ribs. The scapula is a broad, triangular bone with three indentations and four protrusions. Many muscles and joints surround the scapula, connecting the back of the torso to the arms, while the front of the torso is connected to the clavicle. The scapula forms the shoulder joint, connecting to the collarbone on the outer side of the shoulder and to the upper arm bone on the arm side. Like the clavicle, the scapula stabilizes the arms toward the chest, connecting the torso to the arms and transmitting power and movement. If the scapula is unstable, adjacent muscles can easily fatigue, leading to various functional disorders, and ultimately causing muscle damage. Therefore, scapular stabilization exercises such as push-ups against a wall, lifting the body up with hands on the ground, and prone rowing are necessary.
