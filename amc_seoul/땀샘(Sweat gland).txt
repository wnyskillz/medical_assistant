Sweat glands can be divided into eccrine sweat glands and apocrine sweat glands, which excrete waste and moisture from our body in the form of sweat, helping to regulate body temperature. They are distributed throughout the body. Eccrine sweat glands are found everywhere except the lips, genital area, fingernails, and toenails, while apocrine sweat glands are found in the armpits, eyelids, and around the anus. Sweat glands are located in the dermis layer of the skin. The area around the sweat glands is surrounded by capillaries like a mesh network, and waste products and water filtered from the blood are sent from the capillaries to the sweat glands to produce sweat. The ends of the sweat glands are clustered like bunches and are connected to the skin surface through long ducts through which they secrete sweat. Eccrine sweat glands excrete waste and moisture out of the body in the form of sweat. Additionally, when sweat is released, it absorbs heat from the surroundings and evaporates from the skin surface, helping to lower body temperature and maintain our body temperature. Apocrine sweat glands secrete fatty sweat, which becomes active during puberty when hormone levels increase. Bacteria in the area break down the fatty sweat into fatty acids, causing a distinct smell. In cases of excessive odor, surgical treatment may be performed. Excessive sweating in the armpits is called axillary hyperhidrosis. Sympathetic nerve resection surgery is often performed to suppress sweating in cases of axillary hyperhidrosis. However, compensatory hyperhidrosis may occur after sympathectomy, leading to excessive sweating in other areas as a complication of the surgery.
