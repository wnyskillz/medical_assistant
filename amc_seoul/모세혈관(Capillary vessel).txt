Capillaries are thin blood vessels that connect arterioles and venules in a mesh-like structure, made up of a single layer of endothelial cells, facilitating the exchange of substances between blood and tissues. They are distributed throughout the body. Capillaries are composed of a single layer of endothelium and have a diameter of about 10Î¼m, allowing only one red blood cell to pass through at a time. Capillaries are intertwined in a mesh-like pattern within tissues, and the region where arterioles and venules intertwine at a microscale is called a capillary bed. This capillary bed is further divided into precapillary sphincters, where two types of blood vessels connect, and true capillaries where actual substance exchange occurs. There are smooth muscles at the entrance of capillaries that regulate blood flow, while pericytes located on the vessel wall regulate the flow of blood. Capillaries perform the function of exchanging oxygen, nutrients, waste products, etc., between blood vessels and tissues. Capillaries located at the end of arteries receive carbon dioxide and waste products from arteriolar blood supplying nutrients and oxygen to tissues, subsequently circulating as venous blood. When the capillaries on the skin of the face dilate, the skin may appear red or show visible blood vessels on the surface. This indicates that the blood vessels of the skin have expanded closer to the skin's surface. Particularly on the face, neck, head, and chest, the skin may appear red and be sensitive to temperature changes. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid sudden temperature fluctuations, direct sunlight, stimulating foods, and caffeine. Taking vitamins to strengthen capillary walls is beneficial.
