The larynx can be divided into three parts: the supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis, with the supraglottis located between the base of the brain and the hard palate, the glottis in the middle behind the mouth, and the subglottis at the lowest part connecting to the esophagus with the larynx in the front. It plays a role in separating air and food, allowing them to pass well into the esophagus without mixing. Various muscles and nerves related to swallowing food are developed, making it possible to swallow food. When food passes, the epiglottis covers the glottis to prevent food from entering the windpipe. The supraglottis serves as an air passage connected to the nose and plays an important role in maintaining middle ear pressure. The immune function of the larynx performs immune functions with various lymphoid tissues distributed. The larynx is an important organ involved in resonance and articulation functions. One of the most common diseases causing a sore throat and fever is tonsillitis. When infected with tonsillitis, swallowing saliva or food can be painful, and the swollen tonsils can be seen as red. While the treatment for tonsillitis is similar to common colds, if tonsillitis recurs chronically, it may lead to complications in other organs such as the heart, which may require tonsillectomy.
