The smallest salivary gland, the sublingual gland, weighs 2g. It is not covered by a capsule and is dispersed in the surrounding tissues, containing numerous Rivinus ducts where the base of the tongue meets the floor of the mouth. These ducts come together to form the Bartholin ducts. They secrete a mixture of mucous-rich secretion under the mucous membrane below the tongue on both sides. The secretory ducts connected to the sublingual glands open into the mucosa under the tongue. When food enters the mouth, saliva is secreted from many salivary glands. The parasympathetic nervous system is activated to secrete saliva when the submandibular glands are stimulated through several ganglia via the branches of the autonomic nervous system. Saliva helps to soften food and contains the digestive enzyme amylase, assisting in digestion. It also acts as a defense mechanism by secreting antimicrobial substances through saliva, helping to prevent cavities or gum disease. Additionally, it lubricates the throat when speaking. The produced saliva is secreted into the mouth through the sublingual duct. Salivary gland stones are called sialoliths, and about 90% of them occur under the molars while the rest form in the sublingual and submandibular glands. Small stones may be expelled due to increased saliva production, and gently massaging the area where the salivary glands are located about 30 minutes after eating may help the stone to naturally dislodge. In cases where stones are located near the salivary gland duct, they can be removed through endoscopy or surgically removed if necessary. To prevent the formation of salivary stones, it is important to prevent foreign substances and bacteria from accumulating within the salivary glands or prevent calcium from depositing. Above all, the best method is to maintain oral hygiene and ensure an adequate intake of fluids. Chewing gum or consuming sour foods can also help stimulate proper saliva secretion.
