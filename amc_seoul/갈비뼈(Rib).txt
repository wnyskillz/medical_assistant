The rib cage protects internal chest organs such as the lungs and heart, and helps with breathing by expanding and contracting the thoracic cavity. The rib cage surrounds the entire chest, forming the thoracic cage. The human body has a total of 12 pairs of ribs. Ribs 1-7 are directly attached to the sternum through joints, called true ribs, while ribs 8-12, called false ribs, differ. Ribs 8, 9, and 10 are indirectly connected to the sternum through shared cartilage, while ribs 11 and 12, known as floating ribs, are not connected to the sternum. When we breathe in, the diaphragm contracts and the rib cage expands, allowing air to enter the lungs. When we breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes and the rib cage contracts, expelling air from the lungs. Ribs can break or fracture if subjected to external impact or excessive force. If a rib is fractured or cracked, no separate surgery is necessary â€“ instead, a protective device is worn to allow the bone to heal naturally. However, if rib fractures lead to damage of internal organs protected by the ribs, such as causing bleeding or pneumothorax (air leakage from the lungs creating a collapsed lung), complications can be dangerous.
