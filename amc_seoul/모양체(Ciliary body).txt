The ciliary body connects the sclera and iris, and the fine fibers in the ciliary body fix the lens and, at the same time, change the curvature of the lens by the ciliary body muscles to adjust the focus. It surrounds the lens between the sclera and the iris inside the eye. The choroid is a thin membrane with many blood vessels and melanin pigment distributed, located in the middle of the eye wall, composed of the ciliary body, sclera, and iris. The ciliary body is composed of muscles, blood vessels, and epithelium, a triangular tissue connecting the ends of the sclera and iris. The ciliary body is composed of ciliary muscles and ciliary processes, and the ciliary muscles adjust the movement of the lens in three different directions. The ciliary body receives blood supply from the iris artery and consists of two layers of epithelial cells. It functions to fix and adjust the lens, altering the curvature of the lens by contracting and relaxing the included muscles and fibers. When the ciliary muscle contracts, the ciliary suspensory ligaments that hold the lens are extended, and the lens thickens to focus on closer objects; when the ciliary muscle relaxes, the suspensory ligaments shorten and the lens thins to focus on distant objects. By adjusting the thickness of the lens with the ciliary body, the curvature of the lens is adjusted to focus on objects near or far. Aqueous humor in the eye refers to the transparent fluid that fills between the cornea and lens and between the iris and lens, the ciliary processes function in producing and draining aqueous humor inside the eye. Aqueous humor maintains a constant intraocular pressure to prevent the eye from collapsing. If the aqueous humor does not drain properly and the pressure inside the eye increases, it is called glaucoma. Glaucoma surgery aims to lower the intraocular pressure by securing the drainage pathways between the chambers to remove excess aqueous humor.
