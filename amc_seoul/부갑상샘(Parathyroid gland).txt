The parathyroid gland is located on the posterior side of the outer layer of the thyroid gland and consists of four glands, two on each side of the body. It secretes parathyroid hormone, which regulates the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in our body. It is located behind the thyroid gland in the front part of the neck. Occasionally, it can also be located within or in the chest. There is one parathyroid gland below and above each side of the thyroid gland, with a total of four, each shaped like an oval grain of yellow color measuring around 5mm. The average weight of one parathyroid gland is about 120mg for males and 142mg for females, and it is considered abnormal if the weight exceeds 60mg. Parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid gland, along with hormones like vitamin D and calcitonin, helps regulate the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in the body. When the blood calcium level is high, calcium receptors are activated, leading to a decrease in hormone secretion. Conversely, when the blood calcium level is low, hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland cells increases. Parathyroid hormone mainly acts on bones, kidneys, and intestines and interacts with vitamin D. It increases the movement of calcium from bones to blood, promotes calcium absorption in the intestines and kidneys, and stimulates the secretion of phosphates, reducing the concentration of phosphates in the blood. In conclusion, the secretion of parathyroid hormone increases calcium levels and the conversion of vitamin D. Excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone can lead to low calcium levels in bones, causing osteoporosis and calcification of other tissues. Parathyroid hormone tests are conducted when blood calcium levels are higher or lower than normal range, or before thyroid-related surgeries. Hyperparathyroidism is the overproduction of parathyroid hormone, causing the breakdown of calcium from the skeletal system into the blood, increased reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys and intestines, leading to hypercalcemia. Symptoms include overall weakness, decreased muscle strength, and complications in the kidneys due to excessive calcium excretion. Foods high in calcium and low in phosphorus include salmon, eggs, oysters, shellfish, green vegetables, agar, sweet potatoes, sea squirt, mugwort, shrimp, sea cucumbers, seaweed, herbs, and dinggle. Cheese and dairy products have high amounts of both calcium and phosphorus, while carbonated beverages have high phosphorus content, so they should be avoided. Almonds and spinach contain substances that hinder calcium absorption. Processed foods with sodium phosphates hinder calcium intake.
