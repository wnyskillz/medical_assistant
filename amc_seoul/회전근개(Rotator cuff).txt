If you log in, you can take advantage of even more benefits. There are four muscles and tendons surrounding the shoulder joint that enable lifting and rotating the arm. Positioned on both shoulders, they form the shoulder joint with the humerus (upper arm bone), scapula (shoulder blade), and clavicle (collarbone), along with four muscles (deltoid, teres major, infraspinatus, subscapularis) and tendons forming the rotator cuff. Starting from the scapula at the back of the shoulder, the muscles transition into tendons that firmly attach to the humerus. These four muscles function together like a unit in rotating the arm inward or outward at the shoulder. The shoulder joint is the only joint in the body capable of 360-degree rotation, offering the widest range of motion. The rotator cuff maintains stability within the range of motion of the shoulder joint, helping to immobilize the humerus and assisting in arm movement. It also aids in moving the arms away from the body and elevating or lowering the shoulders. Between the scapula and the rotator cuff, there is a bursa that minimizes friction between the two during shoulder joint movement, allowing for smooth articulation. The movements of the hands and arms in daily activities are facilitated by the action of the rotator cuff muscles. These muscles surround the shoulder joint, providing strong support for movement of the hands and arms without strain. If you often experience shoulder stiffness or heaviness and want your arms and hands to move more efficiently, try the following exercises in your office or at home. Performing each exercise for 5-10 repetitions, 3-5 sets is effective. Adjust the repetitions based on your strength level, and take rests between sets until fatigue is completely alleviated. 1. Shoulder Blade Squeeze with Elbow Flexion Stand up straight and extend both arms to the sides at a 90-degree angle, forming a right angle at the elbows. While maintaining this position, repeatedly squeeze the shoulder blades together as if trying to touch them and then release. 2. Desk Dips Place your hands on a desk and assume a dip position. Bend and straighten your arms at about a 45-degree angle. Be cautious not to lift your hips upward or release tension in your lower back. 3. Chair Press Up Sit on a chair with armrests and grasp the armrests with your hands. Without relying on your legs or waist, use your arms and shoulder strength to lift your body weight by bending your elbows. Repeat the bending and straightening of the elbows at approximately a 45-degree angle. Be mindful not to raise the upper part of your shoulders (shrugging position). 4. External Rotation with Resistance Band Stand upright with an open chest and proper posture. Grab a resistance band with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keeping the elbows close to your body, extend both hands outward at a 45-degree angle.
