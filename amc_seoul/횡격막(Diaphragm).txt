The diaphragm assists in breathing movements by contracting and relaxing. It is bent upwards, with the highest point containing the pericardium and the heart, the sides containing the pleura and lungs, and the lower part containing the peritoneum and abdominal organs. The muscle fibers of the diaphragm originate from three different areas: the lower six ribs at the inner edges of the chest, lumbar vertebrae 2-3, and the inner part of the xiphoid process. These muscle fibers converge at the center of the diaphragm's tendons. The central tendon of the diaphragm, being attached to the tissues that surround the lungs, helps in pulling air in during inhalation and releasing air during exhalation. The diaphragm is controlled by the phrenic nerve and contains the aortic opening, vena cava opening, and esophageal hiatus that connect the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Through contraction and relaxation, the diaphragm aids in breathing. When we inhale, the diaphragm contracts, lowering and reducing pressure in the thoracic cavity, allowing air to enter the lungs. When we exhale, the diaphragm relaxes, moving upwards, allowing air to exit the lungs. It also plays a role in increasing abdominal pressure during bowel movements and vomiting. During inhalation, the diaphragm contracts to expand the lungs, allowing air to enter while pressing down on the abdominal organs below, causing the abdomen to protrude. During exhalation, the diaphragm relaxes, allowing air to leave the lungs, while the abdominal organs are less compressed, causing the abdomen to return to its original state. This is known as diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing.
