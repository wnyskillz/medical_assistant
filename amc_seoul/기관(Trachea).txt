A structure connecting the larynx and the trachea serves as a passage for the inflow and outflow of air as well as a pathway for eliminating secretions in the bronchi. Located in the front part of the neck, it connects the larynx and the lungs. The respiratory system is divided into the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nose, nasal cavity, oral cavity, sinuses, pharynx, and larynx, while the lower respiratory tract is composed of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. The trachea, which is the starting point of the lower respiratory tract, is approximately 2 cm in diameter at the beginning, with a length of about 10-11 cm. The trachea descends vertically in front of the esophagus starting below the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae and bifurcates into the left and right bronchi at the level of the 5th thoracic vertebra behind the heart. The long part of the trachea is located in the neck, while the remaining short part is located inside the thoracic cavity. The bifurcated bronchi on the left and right divide into various branches and connect to alveoli, forming the lungs. The front part of the trachea is made up of 16-20 cartilage rings connected in a C-shaped manner, while the back part is rich in smooth muscles that attach firmly to the esophagus. The mucous membrane lining the inside of the trachea is ciliated, containing mucous glands, while lymphatic nodules are distributed outside the trachea. The mucous membrane lining of the trachea helps maintain adequate humidity as air flows into the lungs. Additionally, if foreign substances enter the trachea, the cilia on the mucous membrane act to expel the substances mixed with lymph reflexively in the form of coughing, expelling them out of the oral cavity. The trachea serves to prevent foreign substances from moving deeper into the lower respiratory tract. If the upper part of the trachea becomes blocked, breathing becomes difficult and poses a threat to life. When the trachea is blocked or narrowed by foreign substances or secretions, inhibiting the smooth flow of air, a small hole is made in the neck to allow air to enter the lungs, a procedure known as tracheostomy. By inserting a tracheostomy tube into the hole, an airway is secured, enabling breathing even when breathing through the nose is difficult. Moreover, this airway can also be used as a pathway for removing secretions from the bronchi in patients who cannot spontaneously clear secretions.
