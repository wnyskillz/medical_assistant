Logging in allows you to enjoy more benefits. It refers to the joint consisting of eight bones between the forearm and the hand. It is located between the two parts connecting the forearm and the hand. The wrist joint is formed by the union of 8 wrist bones (carpal bones) and the ulna and radius of the forearm. The wrist bones consist of 8 bones arranged horizontally and vertically in a complex manner, with each bone having a different shape according to the function of the wrist it is responsible for. Within the wrist joint, there are many ligaments that secure the wrist and muscles responsible for the movement of the wrist. The ligaments inside the wrist bones connect the wrist bones and are called intrinsic ligaments. Conversely, on the outside of the wrist bones, there are extrinsic ligaments connecting the wrist bones to the forearm. The most commonly fractured part of the wrist joint is the distal end of the radius, and if a fracture affects the joint, it can cause swelling and deformity. The wrist allows free movement in various directions due to multiple bones and a complex joint. The wrist can bend forward and backward with a range of motion of about 80 degrees, tilt towards the body with a range of motion of 30 degrees, and away from the body with a range of motion of 20 degrees. The ligaments and muscles connecting the ulna and the wrist allow for rotational movements of the hand and forearm, and the ligaments between the wrist bones provide strong support to the wrist bones. Excessive use of the constantly moving hand can lead to accumulated fatigue and result in pain in the wrist and elbow. If you experience wrist numbness or elbow pain, try the following exercises: 1. Elbow Muscle Press + Wrist Rotation: Press firmly with the opposite hand on the thickest muscle just below the elbow in front of the arm with the palm facing up, then slowly rotate the wrist. Repeat 10 times for 3-5 sets. 2. Arm Extension + Pressing the Back of the Hand Down: Grab the back of the hand with the opposite hand and pull it down while the arm is extended forward with the palm facing up. Rotate the elbow part towards the sky until you feel a slight tightness in the muscles of the forearm. Repeat for 20 seconds for 3-5 sets. 3. Arm Extension + Pressing the Palm Down (15-20 seconds, 3-5 sets): Grab the palm with the opposite hand and pull it down while the arm is extended forward with the palm facing up. Maintain a state where the muscles of the forearm feel slightly tight. 20 seconds 4. Arm Extension + Wrist Rotation (10 times, 3-5 sets): Rotate both arms to the maximum with the elbows extended. Slowly rotate with the wrist bent upwards, feeling the whole muscles of the forearm and shoulder stretching. Wrist Fracture Prevention When carrying hands in pockets, it is difficult to maintain balance and easy to fall. Therefore, wear gloves or similar items. Wet bathroom floors can cause slipping and injuries, so it is good to remove moisture from the floor or use mats. In dimly lit environments, make sure the house is well-lit and arrange items to avoid tripping. When using stairs, hold railings if possible. When snowboarding, skiing, or inline skating, always wear wrist guards. Consume foods that can supplement calcium and vitamin D regularly (anchovies, milk, seaweed, oysters, salmon, clams, shrimp, crab, beans, tofu, kelp, walnuts, sea cucumbers, cabbage, barley, brown rice).
