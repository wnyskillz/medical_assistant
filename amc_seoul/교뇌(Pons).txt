The pons, located just below the midbrain and being a part of the brainstem, has evolved as an intermediate pathway for transmitting neural information or receiving information from the cerebellum. Among the 12 pairs of cranial nerves, the 4 pairs of motor nerves entering and exiting the face and the sensory nerves entering the face start and end here. It also serves as a pathway for connecting the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. Connecting the midbrain and the medulla oblongata in the brainstem, it forms the hindbrain along with the cerebellum. A portion of the brainstem that bulges forward, connecting the left and right cerebellar hemispheres like a bridge, is named the pons. At the lower part of the pons, crossover fibers connect the brainstem and the cerebellum. The lower portion of the pons is attached to the cerebellum forming a ridge and is separate from the medulla, while the upper part is adjacent to the bottom of the fourth ventricle. Internally, it is divided into the upper pons and the lower pons floor. The upper pons is where sensory and motor basic conductions take place, with clusters of nerve cells. The lower pons floor is a newly developed part due to the development of the cerebral cortex, consisting of nerve cell groups and fiber groups related to the cerebellum, connected by nerve fibers from the cerebral cortex. It facilitates information transmission between the cerebellum and the cerebrum, and plays a role in respiratory control along with the medulla. Several nuclei located in the pons are responsible for eye movement, facial sensation, and facial muscle movement.
