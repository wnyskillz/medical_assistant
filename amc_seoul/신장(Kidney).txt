The kidneys are located beneath the transverse processes, behind the abdomen, and play a role in removing waste from our bodies and regulating the amount of water, salt, electrolytes, and acid-base balance in the body. They are located behind the abdomen, on either side of the spine. The right kidney is located just below the liver, while the left kidney is below the diaphragm, near the spleen, with the right kidney positioned lower than the left kidney. The kidneys are approximately 10cm in length, 5cm in width, 3cm in thickness, and weigh about 150g, shaped like kidney beans, located behind the peritoneum. Inside the kidneys, there are more than one million nephrons densely packed. Nephrons consist of glomeruli and tubules. Glomeruli are clusters of small blood vessels that filter waste products. The water and waste products filtered in the glomeruli pass through the tubules. Essential components are reabsorbed back into the body as they pass through the tubules, while the rest is concentrated to produce the final urine. The kidneys filter about 150L of blood per day through the nephrons, with 99% of the filtrate being reabsorbed in the renal tubules and the remaining 1.5L of concentrated urine being excreted. They remove waste products of metabolism, regulate the amount of water and salt in the body, maintain the balance of electrolytes and acid-base in the blood and body fluids, regulate blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, activate vitamin D to influence calcium absorption and its actions in the body, secrete hormones to stimulate red blood cell production, and regulate fluid balance through the secretion of renin and aldosterone and blood pressure. The kidneys also secrete hormones to regulate blood pressure and blood sugar metabolism. Our bodies have two kidneys. If one kidney fails or is removed due to disease, the other healthy kidney can generally compensate. However, as one kidney must do the work of two, it may enlarge and require careful attention to maintain kidney health through a low-salt diet, blood pressure control, and blood sugar management.
