Ovaries mature follicles to produce eggs, secrete female hormones, and contribute to the secondary sexual characteristics of women, performing a role similar to the testes in males. Eggs produced in the ovaries move to the uterus through the fallopian tubes, and after ovulation, the remaining follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, leading to menstruation. They are located at the end of the fallopian tubes on both sides of a woman's uterus. Ovaries vary in size depending on a woman's age and hormone status, but typically are about 3-5cm long, slightly firm, soft, and almond-shaped. Ovaries can be divided into cortex and medulla. The cortex appears white due to a lack of blood vessels and contains follicles. The medulla contains blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves, and more. Ovaries produce eggs for ovulation and secrete estrogen and progesterone through interactions with hormones from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. If a mature egg is released from the ovary after ovulation, the remaining follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. If the fertilized egg implants in the uterine wall, pregnancy occurs; if not, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to menstruation. A normal menstrual cycle for women is 28 days. Follicles in the ovaries mature the eggs and then degenerate after ovulation. However, if ovulation doesn't occur properly or if the follicle remains like a cyst after ovulation, ovarian cysts can develop. Ovarian cysts may cause pain or bleeding when symptomatic, but regular check-ups are necessary as they often present with no symptoms.
