The major muscles that form the gluteal region include the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus. The gluteus maximus is the largest muscle in our body and covers the outermost part of the buttocks, known as the injection site. The gluteus medius is located inside the gluteus maximus and wraps around the hip joint like a triangle. The gluteus minimus is located inside the gluteus medius. These muscles are mainly involved in the movement of the hip joint. The gluteal muscles function to move the hip joint away from the body's center and rotate the body in a central direction. The gluteus maximus works to pull the pelvis and trunk backward while stabilizing the legs and helps maintain an upright posture. The gluteus medius functions to move the thigh away from the body's center. To prevent urinary incontinence, focus on exercises like pelvic floor exercises, adductor exercises (inner thigh), and glute exercises.1. V-Leg Raise: Lie down with legs extended towards the sky, flexing the ankles at a 90-degree angle. Apply pressure to the inner thighs and abdomen, then spread the legs to about 45 degrees. Maintain tension in the waist to prevent arching. Repeat 3 sets of 10 reps. 2. Kegel Exercises: Lie down with knees bent and shoulder-width apart. Contract the pelvic floor muscles and lift the pelvis. Repeat 3-5 times for 10 seconds each. 3. Knee-to-Chest: Begin in a tabletop position with knees on the floor. Extend one leg back, then bring the knee towards the chest without releasing tension in the glutes. Perform 3 sets of 10 reps. 4. Side Leg Raises: Lie on your side with a pillow under your head and raise the upper leg in front of the body. Keep the lower leg in a bent position with pressure applied to the inner thigh. Engage the core and lift and lower the lower leg about 10 times. Be cautious not to raise the leg too high. Repeat 3 sets for 10-15 seconds each.
