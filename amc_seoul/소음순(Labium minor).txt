It is sensitive to stimulation, and inside the labia minora, there are the clitoris, urethral opening, and vaginal opening. They are located inside the labia majora. The labia minora located inside the labia majora are two folds on each side. The labia minora has many blood vessels, nerves, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, etc., and when spread apart, the clitoris, urethral opening, and vaginal opening are revealed. The labia minora wraps around the clitoris and is pink on the inside. The color, size, and shape of the labia minora vary from individual to individual. It is usually a closed structure to prevent bacteria from invading or drying out and to protect the inside. The labia minora, as a sensitive area, indirectly stimulates the clitoris to allow for experiencing orgasm. Sometimes, correcting a deformed labia minora through surgery can affect sensitivity, so it is important to consider potential side effects when deciding on surgery. Labial minora can enlarge or deform due to continuous stimulation such as tight pants like skinny jeans that could alter the shape. If the labia minora, which is prone to abscesses or inflammation, is frequently touched, the tissue can be stimulated and swell. If genital warts are left untreated or not treated severely, the shape of the labia minora may deform. The genitals contain a lot of melanin pigment, making them generally darker compared to other skin. This does not change due to masturbation or sexual experiences. Furthermore, genitalia, including the labia minora, can change in shape due to stimulation or hormone fluctuations, but since size and shape vary individually, it is not appropriate to generalize and judge. Some people naturally have asymmetrical or larger labia minora, so it should not be misunderstood as related to sexual experiences.
