The fontanel, also known as the soft spot, is located on the newborn's skull which plays a role in allowing the skull to grow and deform as the baby's brain grows. It is located on the newborn and infant's skull. When a baby is born, the skeleton is not fully developed, with some areas of cartilage remaining unossified. There are parts of the skull that do not ossify, known as the fontanel, which connect the bones of the skull with fibrous membranes. The fontanelles can be felt pulsating, representing the baby's heartbeat. The larger diamond-shaped fontanelle on the front of the head is called the anterior fontanelle, while the smaller triangular one near the back is called the posterior fontanelle. The posterior fontanelle usually closes around 3 months after birth, while the anterior fontanelle progressively ossifies and completely closes between 14 to 18 months after birth. Fontanels are flexible, allowing the brain to grow during the later stages of pregnancy and early infancy. If a newborn's skull is fully fused like an adult's, it may limit the brain's ability to grow. The fontanels also serve a function by allowing the baby to pass through the narrow birth canal more easily. The size and timing of closure of fontanels can vary from child to child. In rare cases, disorders related to early fusion of the skull bones or fontanelle abnormalities may occur, so it is important to consult with medical professionals if any abnormal symptoms are observed, such as fontanels being sunken or excessively enlarged. The anterior fontanelle is the part connecting directly to the brain without bones, and when it is under pressure, it can directly transmit pressure to the brain. Care should be taken to ensure the fontanelle is not pressed with excessive force or for prolonged periods as it can raise intracranial pressure in the baby.
