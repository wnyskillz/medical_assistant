The duct, which starts at the lower punctum and upper punctum, leads to the tear sac, connecting to the nasal cavity through the nasolacrimal duct. Tears are produced in the lacrimal gland to moisten and protect the eyes, flowing through the small tear hole near the nose and the nasolacrimal duct to collect in the lacrimal sac near the bridge of the nose, then flow out through the nasal lacrimal duct into the inside of the nose. If the tear duct is blocked, tears cannot be discharged smoothly, causing tears to flow back to the punctum through the nasolacrimal duct or accumulate at the blocked site, which can lead to inflammation spreading to the surrounding tissues. If inflammation occurs at the punctum and persists, the tear duct may narrow and become blocked, leading to the inability of tears to flow through the nasal lacrimal duct, resulting in watery eyes. Treatment can involve inserting a plastic tube or may require surgery depending on the degree of tear duct blockage, and improvement can also be achieved by irrigation or probing with a thin wire. In newborns, the tear duct may open from birth to about 12 months. If the lower end of the nasolacrimal duct does not naturally open and remains blocked, tears can accumulate in the eyes, resulting in frequent eye crusts due to inflammation. In the case of a child with a blocked tear duct, massaging the area above the nose, known as the nasolacrimal duct, can help. If the tear duct does not open naturally, a procedure to create a tear duct using a wire can be performed.
