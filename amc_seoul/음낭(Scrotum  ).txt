There is one on each side of the penis, located behind the penis and in front of the anus. Each of the left and right testicles, which produce sperm, and the epididymis, which stores sperm, are located in the left and right scrotums. The scrotum surrounding them is composed of thin skin, with melanin pigments deposited making the skin darker than other areas. The surface of the scrotum has many gentle wrinkles due to the absence of subcutaneous tissue, and coarse and stiff hair follicles. The hair follicles are the hair around the scrotum and increase with growth. Inside the scrotum, a pair of testicles, epididymis, and vas deferens are wrapped in multiple layers of connective tissue. The adult testicles are located inside the scrotum, but during fetal development, the testicles are initially located in the abdominal cavity, then descend into the scrotum by being wrapped in the peritoneum as they grow. However, there are cases where the testicles do not descend fully and remain in the abdomen at birth. This condition is called undescended testicles. The scrotum protects the testicles and helps maintain a temperature slightly lower than the normal body temperature of 98.6°F (37°C). It contracts when cold or during exercise and expands and relaxes in warm places. The scrotum protects the testicles by surrounding them and maintains them at a lower temperature to protect them. The scrotum is also known as the sac or pouch of the male reproductive system, and if external pressure is applied, it produces a significant impact. Therefore, excessive pressure on the scrotum or inadequate temperature regulation can lead to infertility. If the path through which the testicle descends into the scrotum remains open, the intestines may be pushed into the scrotum due to increased abdominal pressure. Accumulation of intestinal fluids in the scrotum can lead to a condition known as hydrocele. If the temperature around the testicle rises, it can interfere with the process of sperm formation in the testicles. It is known that bathing in hot water or wearing tight clothes, undergarments, etc., can raise the temperature of the testicles and induce infertility. It is also known that the type of underwear worn by men can affect the temperature and infertility rate of the testicles, and wearing tight briefs rather than loose boxers can increase the incidence of infertility. Currently, it is believed that boxers are better for maintaining testicular function than briefs, and especially for those suffering from testicular pain, it is considered better to change underwear first.
