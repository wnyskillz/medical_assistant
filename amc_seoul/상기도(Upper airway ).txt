It starts from the nose, passes through the back of the mouth, and leads to the throat. The upper airway refers to the path through which air flows from the nose to the larynx. Nasal cavity: The upper part of the nasal cavity is where the olfactory nerve is distributed, while the lower part is covered with a mucous membrane rich in blood vessels. Sinuses: Air-filled cavities within the skull, consisting of four sinuses - frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. Sinuses are located between the nasal cavity and the mucous membrane, and sinus infections can occur when upper airway infections arise. Pharynx: The pharynx is a muscular organ located between the back of the mouth and the larynx, approximately 13 cm in length. It is commonly referred to as the throat and is divided into regions based on location: nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. Larynx: A triangular cartilaginous structure where air passes between the pharynx and the trachea. In the middle of the larynx, there are two mucous membrane folds called vocal cords. The upper airway protects the vocal cords and airway. It prevents food from being aspirated into the airway by closing and opening the vocal cords when speaking, along with the cough reflex. The cilia in the upper airway filter out foreign particles from the air, humidifies and warms the inhaled air. To prevent upper respiratory infections, drink plenty of water, rest, wear comfortable clothes instead of tight clothing, maintain a healthy weight, rinse your mouth with mouthwash, and if needed, take prescribed pain relievers, mucus thinners, and antibiotics. In group settings where infections spread easily, wash hands frequently, maintain oral hygiene, exercise regularly, consume nutrients to boost immunity. To maintain the body's resistance, avoid overworking, lack of sleep, reduce stress, and maintain regular living habits. Upper airway and sleep apnea: Sleep apnea patients may experience airway closure due to positional changes during sleep, leading to reduced quality of sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss can improve sleep apnea in obese individuals, but if ineffective, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation can be used to provide continuous oxygen during sleep and prevent apnea. Surgical options include uvulopalatopharyngoplasty to enlarge the airway by removing part of the uvula and soft palate.
