If the nail turns blue, it indicates a lack of oxygen supply to the tip of the finger, and if the nail becomes extra soft like a sponge, joint problems should be considered. It plays a role in protecting the fingertips, providing strength to the fingers, and assisting in finger use.

Generally, it takes about 5-6 months for nails to grow from the root to the tip.
