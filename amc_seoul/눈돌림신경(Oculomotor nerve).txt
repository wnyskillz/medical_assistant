It originates from the side of the eye and connects to the midbrain. Nerve fibers from the midbrain extend to the eye. This nerve also includes autonomic nerve fibers that reflexively control the movement of the eye's pupil, distributed in the ciliary muscles and the pupillary constrictor muscle. Blood vessels that supply nutrients to the oculomotor nerve are located at the center of the nerve and affect the fibers that control the external eye muscles. The oculomotor nerve is a motor nerve that controls eye movements or movements of the pupil. It provides motor nerve fibers to four out of the six muscles that directly act on the eye. The extraocular muscles, such as the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, control the shape of the eye, eyelid, lens, and pupil size. Sympathetic nerve fibers are involved in regulating the focus of the eye. An increase in intracranial pressure can compress the occipital nerve, leading to the inability to adjust the size of the pupil. Increased intracranial pressure can paralyze the pupillary reflex, causing the pupil to dilate or remain fixed. If oculomotor nerve paralysis occurs due to various causes, symptoms such as ptosis, pupil dilatation, downward deviation of the eye due to muscle action, or displacement outward may occur. When strabismus occurs, each eye sends two different visual information to the brain by looking at different objects, causing visual confusion when completely different objects appear overlapped, leading to experiencing diplopia. Therefore, patients give up receiving visual information from both eyes to resolve the confusion, which can lead to amblyopia. If strabismus is not treated quickly, vision may not recover, so early treatment of strabismus in children is crucial.
