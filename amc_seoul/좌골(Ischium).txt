Behind it, there is a sacral promontory which serves as the attachment point for ligaments supporting the pelvis, and below it, there is the ischial tuberosity where several leg muscles attach, positioned at the lower back part of both pelvises and situated behind the coccyx and below the sacrum. The sacrum is one of three bones that make up the pelvis, and together, these bones form the sacroiliac joint. The posterior part of the sacrum has a feature called the sacral promontory where ligaments supporting the pelvis are attached, and the ischial tuberosity below serves as a thick, rough surface where muscles attaching to the leg are anchored. The sacroiliac joint which connects the sacrum to the ilium muscles allows for a strong connection from the pelvis to the leg. When sitting on the lower part of the pelvis, it supports the weight, stabilizes the pelvis in place, and attaches the leg muscles. A condition that occurs when discs between the vertebrae protrude and compress nerves going to the legs, causing severe pain, sensory issues, and muscle weakness, is called a herniated disc. This can lead to pain radiating down the back of the leg, causing sciatica. When the sciatic nerve is affected, pain resembling burning or tingling can radiate from the lower back to the buttocks, thighs, and down to the feet, along with symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or muscle weakness in the affected leg. In many cases, symptoms can improve with bed rest, physical therapy, and medication, but for patients with persistent or worsening symptoms, procedures like nerve blocks may be performed. If there is weakness in both lower limbs or severe symptoms, surgical treatment may be necessary.
