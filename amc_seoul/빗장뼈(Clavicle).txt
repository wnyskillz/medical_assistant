It is located above the chest and on both shoulders. It is a long bone that connects the sternum in the middle of the chest and the scapula (shoulder blade), and the end where it meets the sternum is round, and the part where it meets the scapula is flat, forming a long S shape. The end of the sternum articulates with the sternum and the acromion process of the scapula to form a joint. The front of the sternum is connected to the chest muscles, the back to the back muscles, and nerves coming out of the cervical spine and blood vessels from the neck pass through the center of the sternum. Unlike other long bones, the clavicle does not have a marrow cavity and is made of spongy bone material inside. There are brachial plexus nerves around the clavicle, including the supraclavicular nerve dominating the upper part of the back and chest, and the infraclavicular nerve dominating the rest of the arm and chest. The clavicle connects the trunk and scapula to support and act as a strut so that the humerus (upper arm bone) can move freely at the shoulder joint. It also absorbs shocks transmitted from the humerus. Clavicle fractures usually occur due to direct impacts like falls. Fractures can also occur by falling on an outstretched arm or hitting the chest on the steering wheel during a car collision, and in infants, collarbone injury can occur during childbirth. Many nerves and blood vessels are distributed around the clavicle, so severe fractures can cause nerve paralysis in the arm or circulatory disorders. Injuries to the clavicle can be confirmed through a simple x-ray examination.
