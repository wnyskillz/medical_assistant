When light from objects is captured by the retina and forms an image on it, it is received through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is the second of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves, also known as the second cranial nerve. It plays a role in transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. Starting from the retina of the eye, the nerve fibers known as the optic nerve connect to the visual cortex, a part of the brain. Two optic nerve fibers partially cross, then become optic tracts connecting to the visual center. The optic nerve is composed of nerve cell bodies and fibers, totaling over a million nerve fibers. The fovea is a specialized area without rods or cones that causes blind spots. The optic nerve can be observed through an ophthalmoscope. The optic nerve is a sensory nerve that transmits visual stimuli. Visual information incoming through the retina is conveyed to the brain's occipital lobe via electrical stimulation. The optic nerve transmits information on brightness perception, red and green color perception, contrast, and visual field to the brain. Even if the structure of the eye is normal, having underdeveloped optic nerves or brains can result in significantly lower vision than that of a normal person. Once the optic nerve is damaged, the damaged area does not recover to a normal level, so it is important to prevent and halt the progression of optic nerve damage in advance.
