If you log in, you can enjoy even more benefits. It is a nervous system that enables you to cope with emergency situations. It emerges from the spinal cord from the first thoracic vertebra to the third lumbar vertebra, controlling the overall internal organs, most blood vessels, skin, salivary glands, and adrenal glands. The nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system start from the cell bodies of spinal nerves, extend up and down, connecting through ganglia to form a sympathetic ganglia chain. This part extends from the side of the spine to the pelvic region, sending nerve fibers to all parts of our body. When connected not to nerves but to the heart and lungs, it forms paravertebral ganglia to provide nerves to the abdominal and pelvic organs. The sympathetic nervous system creates a force that allows our body to quickly and strongly adapt in case of excitement, emergency, or crisis situations. When facing such situations, our body's heart beats faster, breathing deepens, skin cools and becomes moist, scalp tightens, and pupils dilate. These reactions increase heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, relax the bronchial tubes, and help cope with stressful situations. The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body to respond to threats by running faster, seeing better, or thinking more clearly. It contributes to maintaining homeostasis in the body by interacting with the parasympathetic nervous system to respond to the external environment. Persisting refractory hypertension can lead to serious conditions such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. If three types of antihypertensive medications do not reach normal blood pressure levels, in cases of refractory hypertension that require more than four medications, nerve block procedures can be performed through arterial catheters to electrically block renal nerves related to blood pressure, reducing blood pressure. Surgical sympathectomy is also performed for localized hyperhidrosis. It is a method of blocking the thoracic sympathetic nerves through thoracoscopic surgery, which is effective, permanent, and widely used clinically. However, compensatory hyperhidrosis, where sweating occurs in areas that did not sweat before surgery, can occur in some individuals. Sympathetic nerve block procedures are also performed for post-herpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, musculoskeletal pain disorders, malignant tumors with thoracic metastases, unexplained chest pain.
