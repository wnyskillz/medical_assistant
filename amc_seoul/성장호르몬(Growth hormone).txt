It is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland located in the brain. Growth hormone is a hormone composed of 191 amino acids. It plays a role in increasing skeletal muscles and long bones to determine the final size of the body. The hormone converts amino acids into proteins, promotes the growth of target cells, and is involved in the metabolic action of the body by breaking down fat in the liver, stimulating fat for energy use. As a result, body fat decreases, energy expenditure increases, and it also regulates the balance of water and minerals. The secretion pattern of growth hormone varies according to age and gender. Generally, it is vigorously secreted when falling into deep sleep early in the night, while children also secrete growth hormone vigorously during daytime. As one ages, the secretion of growth hormone that was vigorously secreted decreases overall, so that by the time one becomes elderly, the secretion of growth hormone diminishes to the point of being deficient. In males, growth hormone is secreted at its peak for a short period of time, while in females, it is secreted continuously for a long time showing gradual changes. Growth hormone secretion is minimal at birth and for the first few years, maintaining a high level during childhood and peaking during puberty, and then steadily maintaining a very low level in adulthood. Growth hormone deficiency can be diagnosed through blood tests. Growth hormone levels can change throughout the day, so if the concentration of growth hormone in repeatedly collected blood samples is confirmed to be below 5ng/mL after administering a drug that stimulates growth hormone secretion, it can be diagnosed as growth hormone deficiency. Additionally, the IGF-1 test, a hormone produced in the liver by the stimulation of growth hormone, can be performed relatively easily as it does not fluctuate much within a day. If the level is found to be below 2 standard deviations from the level of a healthy individual, it can be diagnosed as growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone injections are effective for children with a deficiency in growth hormone secretion, but they are not effective for children with normal hormone levels but short stature. The timing and duration of administration are important as the effects can vary depending on the age and starting point of administration. Possible side effects of growth hormone injections include scoliosis, hip dislocation, temporary diabetes, headaches, swelling, vomiting, and therefore indiscriminate injection therapy can harm the child. Healthy lifestyle habits are important for increasing a child's height. Adequate sleep, regular exercise, and balanced nutrition are necessary. Engaging in aerobic exercise that makes you sweat for 30 minutes or more 3-4 times a week stimulates growth plates. It is also important to have a regular intake of three meals with sufficient calcium, and avoid instant foods, sugar, and carbonated drinks for balanced nutrient intake. Childhood obesity can hinder growth. Many children who were chubby in childhood remain so even after growing up. Gaining weight in childhood means increasing the number of fat cells, which is different from obesity in adults where the volume of fat cells increases. Once the number of fat cells increases, it is not easy to reduce them through dieting, making childhood obesity a potential time bomb for gaining weight again in the future. The likelihood of childhood obesity leading to adult obesity is very high, around 60-80%, so it is very important to prevent an increase in the number of fat cells during this period. Recklessly adjusting calorie intake can have a negative impact on a child's growth and bodily functions, so supporting growth through a healthy and proper diet is the most important. Growth hormone, essential for growth, not only helps a child grow but also burns fat. If a child is obese, growth hormone is more focused on burning fat, which can slow down growth. It is important to redirect the busy growth hormone towards a child's growth. By losing weight through diet, growth hormone can be adequately used for a child's growth. It is more effective to reduce fat through aerobic exercise than to simply reduce body weight. Escaping obesity is not only about returning to a slim figure but also about creating a healthy and growing height. Excess fat stimulates the secretion of growth hormone, which is why obese children experience early puberty. Therefore, reducing fat in a child through exercise and dietary control can buy time for the child's growth.
