A major blood vessel descending from the heart, it runs vertically along the abdominal area around the navel. The aorta is one of the largest blood vessels in our body, consisting of three layers that can withstand strong pressure. Composed of intima, media, and adventitia, the aorta is elastic and sturdy to withstand the strong pressure from the heart's contractions. In a normal adult, the diameter of the aorta is about 2-2.5cm and extends from the diaphragm to the fourth lumbar vertebra. The abdominal aorta is divided into anterior and posterior sections, adjacent to various organs. The anterior portion is adjacent to the duodenum, stomach, jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, and transverse colon, while the posterior portion is adjacent to the transverse colon, splenic flexure, and rectum. The abdominal aorta branches into two iliac arteries in the lower abdomen. Following the sequential descent of the abdominal aorta, it supplies oxygen-rich arterial blood to each organ. Below the diaphragm, the abdominal aorta supplies arterial blood to the upper abdomen, liver, and pancreas, then branches of the artery supply blood to the large intestine and small intestine. Subsequently, it supplies blood to the kidneys, left colon, and rectum in order. The simplest way to check the abdominal aorta is through self-examination. If you feel a pulsating mass near the navel or accidentally notice an enlarged aorta during other abdominal examinations, you should consult a vascular specialist. If the size is small, observation may be an option, but if sudden abdominal or back pain occurs, there may be suspicion of an aortic aneurysm rupture, requiring regular monitoring.
