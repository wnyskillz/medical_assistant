A ventricle refers to one of the two chambers of the heart, functioning to distribute the blood coming from the atrium to the lungs and all corners of the body. The ventricles are located in the lower part of the heart, with the right ventricle being the one on the right side. The heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles, weighing around an average of 300g. Each atrium and ventricle is located on the right and left side, with the right ventricle connected to the pulmonary artery. The right and left ventricles are divided by the interventricular septum. The left ventricle has a broad surface area but relatively thin walls, making it less able to withstand high pressure compared to the right ventricle. The right atrium functions to send the blood that passes through the tricuspid valve to the lungs. Due to its thin walls, it may have problems coping with high pressure. The exact causes of heart defects are difficult to determine. Congenital heart disease and defects are often understood as having genetic causes, where 'congenital' means the heart or blood vessels did not undergo normal development before the baby is born. Since congenital heart disease arising from genetic factors is rare, parents do not need to worry that it is their fault.
