The eye is surrounded by three types of membranes: the outermost is the sclera, the innermost membrane where the nerves are distributed is the retina, and the middle membrane is called the choroid. The choroid in the middle is a thin membrane rich in blood vessels, consisting of the iris that regulates the amount of light, the ciliary body that supports the lens, and the choroid that blocks external light from the eye. In the middle part of the membrane surrounding the eye, the sclera is located outside the choroid and the retina inside. The choroid is composed of three structures with abundant blood vessels and melanin pigment. It consists of the iris that adjusts the size of the pupil like the aperture of a camera, the ciliary body that changes the focus when looking at near and distant objects, and the choroid that supplies nutrients to the retina and acts as a light barrier from the outside. The choroid is prone to inflammation due to its abundant blood vessels. The iris located in the choroid regulates the amount of light, the ciliary body adjusts the focus to ensure a clear image on the retina, and the choroid blocks external light and provides nutrients and oxygen to the retina. Inflammation occurring in the choroid and surrounding tissues is called choroiditis, which can occur due to trauma, bacterial infections, or autoimmune diseases. Located in the middle of the eye wall, the choroid is easily influenced by surrounding tissues. Inflammation originating here can lead to visual impairment, blindness, or even loss of vision. Choroiditis is often discovered after repeated inflammatory episodes with severe changes, leading to vision impairment. If left untreated, vision impairment can progress to blindness, so rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential if choroiditis is suspected.
