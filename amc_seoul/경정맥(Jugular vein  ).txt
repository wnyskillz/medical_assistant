The jugular vein sends oxygen-depleted blood from the head area to the heart. It exists on both sides of the neck and is located in both the superficial and deep layers close to the skin. The jugular vein refers to a pair of veins that bring blood into the front of the neck, running along the lateral aspect of the neck and connecting with the subclavian vein located just behind the clavicle. The jugular vein is divided into two types: external jugular vein and internal jugular vein. The internal jugular vein is formed by the confluence of the sigmoid sinus and facial vein and is located along with the common carotid artery and the vagus nerve. The external jugular vein runs along the surface close to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, with smaller vessels extending towards the lower jaw region. The left and right internal jugular veins connect to the subclavian vein and then meet with venous blood vessels connected to the upper arm and head. These vessels are connected to the superior vena cava through the innominate vein. Unlike arteries, veins have flap structures inside the vein wall to prevent backflow of blood due to the weaker pressure returning to the heart. Through the jugular vein, venous blood from the skull, face, and areas above the neck is connected to the superior vena cava and discharged to the heart. The superior vena cava is one of the major veins that return blood from the upper body to the heart, where venous blood from the head, neck, chest, and arms converge. Oxygen-rich blood ejected from the left ventricle circulates throughout the body, picking up carbon dioxide and waste products, then enters the superior vena cava through the jugular vein and subclavian vein before returning to the right atrium of the heart.
