It is located on the innermost layer of the uterus, with an inner empty space within the uterus. The uterus is an organ composed of multiple layers with a thickness of 2cm, consisting of the thin membrane outer layer called the uterine serosa, the muscular layer inside called the myometrium, and the innermost layer connected to the myometrium called the endometrium. Unlike the myometrium, the endometrium is a soft tissue layer, and the inner part of the endometrium contains an empty space called the uterine cavity. The innermost surface of the uterus is called the endometrium. The endometrium is composed of a functional layer and a basal layer, with the part that thickens and thins every month called the functional layer. The endometrium undergoes development and shedding in sync with a woman's menstrual cycle according to changes in female hormone secretion. The endometrium prepares for pregnancy as it thickens and then thins through a cycle of adaptation approximately every month. During the period of about 10 days before and after ovulation when an egg is released from the ovary, the endometrium becomes most proliferative, creating an optimal environment for the fertilized egg to implant. After implantation, the fertilized egg receives nourishment from the proliferated endometrium, growing into a fetus and forming the placenta. If implantation does not occur, the thickened and developed endometrium sheds and thins out, resulting in menstruation. The layer of the endometrium that begins to thicken in preparation for pregnancy eventually sheds and leads to menstruation if implantation does not occur. Recognizing the absence of menstruation symptoms can help predict pregnancy. Irregular vaginal bleeding and excessive menstrual flow may raise suspicion of endometrial disorders, warranting tests such as vaginal ultrasound. Regular check-ups are necessary for individuals with a family history as they may have an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the likelihood of developing endometrial diseases, so maintaining a healthy weight through appropriate exercise and dietary adjustments is important. Avoiding excessive calorie intake, consuming enough vegetables, and preventing endometrial disorders are all recommended. The severity of menstrual pain varies for each individual, with some women experiencing only slight abdominal discomfort during menstruation while others may have symptoms so severe that they need to visit the emergency room. Associated symptoms range from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lower back pain, pelvic pain, headaches, fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, and even fainting. Menstrual pain may result from specific pelvic conditions or occur during menstruation without any underlying pelvic conditions. It is important to distinguish between the two types of menstrual pain through medical history and uterine tests to determine appropriate treatment. If there is an underlying cause, treating the condition alone may alleviate menstrual pain. Many worry about taking painkillers for menstrual pain, but using painkillers or oral contraceptives to suppress substances that cause pain or to suppress ovulation can be very helpful in alleviating menstrual pain. The timing of painkiller intake varies depending on the individual's menstrual pain pattern. For severe symptoms, fast-acting pain relievers are needed, and for menstrual pain accompanied by vomiting, it is recommended to start taking medication a day or two before menstruation begins. Menstrual pain does not have to be endured as various underlying conditions can cause it. Therefore, precise diagnosis is needed to identify the existence of any underlying conditions causing menstrual pain. if there is an underlying condition causing menstrual pain, it must be treated, while in cases of unexplained menstrual pain, taking painkillers for 1-3 days during each menstrual cycle can improve the condition and help manage symptoms. Irregular eating habits, stress, and high-fat foods can exacerbate menstrual pain, while regular exercise, balanced diet, and stress reduction can help alleviate menstrual pain.
