Stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreted from the pituitary gland, adrenal cortical hormones are secreted. The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys on both sides, and adrenal cortical hormones are secreted into the bloodstream from the outer layer, or the cortex, of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are small organs measuring about 4-5cm in length, 2-3cm in height, and weighing 7-8g. The right adrenal gland is triangular, while the left adrenal gland is crescent-shaped. The outer part of the adrenal gland is called the cortex, and the inner part is called the medulla, each originating from different embryological origins and secreting different hormones into the bloodstream. The regulation of adrenal cortical hormone secretion is controlled by ACTH secreted from the pituitary gland in the brain. Additionally, ACTH is regulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) secreted from the hypothalamus in the brain. In other words, adrenal cortical hormone secretion is regulated by the signaling pathway from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland to the adrenal cortex. There are three types of adrenal cortical hormones. Glucocorticoids mainly affect cellular synthesis and growth in various tissues in the body and exhibit different effects depending on the site of action. Cortisol, secreted by the adrenal cortex, is also known as the "stress hormone" because it stimulates the body's response to defend against harmful external stimuli in situations of severe stress. Therefore, individuals with adrenal insufficiency or those who have suppressed adrenal function due to prolonged use of steroids may be at risk if cortisol secretion does not increase adequately in response to stress. Cortisol also regulates the immune system, including lymphocytes. Mineralocorticoids, like aldosterone, primarily regulate body fluid and electrolyte balance and also play a role in blood pressure regulation. Androgens, as sex hormones, stimulate the growth of pubic hair and armpit hair in women, and some are converted to testosterone, an androgen, which activates androgen receptors. Adrenal cortical hormones (steroids) have metabolic effects in the body. They increase the absorption of amino acids in the liver and kidneys and promote the synthesis of glucose in the body. They break down proteins and fats to produce glucose, provide energy to resist stress, and regulate the concentration of various blood cells in the bloodstream. They also have important anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Adrenal cortical hormones are crucial hormones in the body with various functions. When used as therapeutics, they can be beneficial in many aspects. However, excessive or indiscriminate use can lead to serious side effects. Overuse can increase gastric acid secretion and cause bone loss.
