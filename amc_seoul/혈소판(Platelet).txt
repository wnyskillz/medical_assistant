Platelets are fragments produced when megakaryocytes in the bone marrow are destroyed, and they are irregularly shaped and dispersed in the blood. Platelets are involved in the process of clotting that occurs in the blood plasma when blood vessels are damaged. Platelets do not adhere to the normal smooth inner walls of blood vessels, but they adhere to damaged areas where the endothelium is damaged and collagen fibers are exposed. Attached platelets release chemicals, causing platelets to accumulate and form a platelet plug and release serotonin, which induces blood vessel constriction, reducing blood loss until clotting occurs. The entire blood components are called whole blood, and among them, the platelet component received from a donor is called platelet donation. Platelets corresponding to 6-8 units are obtained from one donor by separating platelet components from whole blood and transfusing them. There are various reasons for platelet reduction, such as when liver function is impaired and cannot produce clotting factors, platelet levels decrease. In cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, antibodies are produced within the body that break down platelets, leading to a decrease in platelet count.
