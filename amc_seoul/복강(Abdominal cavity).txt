The abdomen and viscera are covered by a thin, transparent membrane, and the space within the abdomen surrounded by the membrane is called the abdominal cavity. The abdomen is surrounded by the membrane. Above the abdominal cavity is separated from the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm, and below it is adjacent to the pelvic cavity. In the abdominal cavity, organs such as the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are located and piled up against the membrane. Additionally, there is a small amount of peritoneal fluid inside the abdominal cavity. The organs inside the abdominal cavity are surrounded by the membrane, which serves to protect the organs, and there is a small amount of peritoneal fluid between the parietal peritoneum and visceral peritoneum to reduce friction when the organs move. There are various organs in the abdominal cavity. The accumulation of blood in the abdominal cavity due to the rupture of organs or blood vessels is called intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage can cause abdominal swelling over time and symptoms such as abdominal pain, fainting, low blood pressure. The treatment direction for intra-abdominal hemorrhage is determined by the cause and the patient's condition, and if excessive bleeding occurs, hypovolemic shock may occur, and in severe cases, death may occur, so prompt and appropriate treatment is necessary.
