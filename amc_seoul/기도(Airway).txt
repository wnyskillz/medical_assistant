It starts from the nose and goes down to the throat and chest. It refers to the path that oxygen, carbon dioxide, and waste products from respiration pass through from the nasal cavity and oral cavity to the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. It is divided into upper and lower airways based on location, and the larynx can be included in both upper and lower airways. The upper airway includes the nose, throat, nasal cavity, and larynx, while the lower airway includes the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The airway is the respiratory system that takes in oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide, and it is involved in the breathing process. In the airway, the temperature and humidity of the air entering through the nose and mouth are regulated, and when swallowing food, the larynx closes to prevent food from being sucked into the airway. Most airways have tiny hairs coated with mucus called cilia, which trap external particles, bacteria, and microbes entering the airway and expel them out through coughing or sneezing. Upper airway infections are the most common infections in children and adults, including acute viral rhinitis (common cold), sinusitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, and laryngotracheitis. If a foreign object flows into the airway through the relaxed tongue or epiglottis, airway obstruction occurs. Sounds of wheezing may be heard at the throat blocked by a foreign object, the person may try to grab their throat and spit out the object, and their face may turn blue. If the airway is completely blocked, loss of consciousness occurs within 4 minutes, and permanent brain damage occurs after 6 minutes, so prompt emergency treatment is necessary. In the emergency treatment of adults with airway obstruction due to a foreign object, if the person can speak, they are encouraged to cough to expel the object, and if unsuccessful, call 119. If the person cannot speak, call 119 and perform the Heimlich maneuver to remove the foreign object. The Heimlich maneuver is performed by standing behind the patient, wrapping arms around the waist, making a fist with the right hand and placing it above the navel, then pressing upwards till the object comes out. Pregnant or obese patients should have chest compressions instead of the Heimlich maneuver. If the person is unconscious, perform CPR. In the emergency treatment of infants with airway obstruction due to a foreign object, tilt the infant's head downward, tap the back five times, then perform chest compressions five times. If the foreign object is not removed after chest compressions, or if the person loses consciousness, perform CPR.
