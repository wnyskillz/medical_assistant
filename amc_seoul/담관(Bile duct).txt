It is located on the upper right side and connects from the liver to the duodenum inside. The bile duct is divided into sections depending on the area, and accordingly, its diameter varies. Hepatic duct: a thin bile duct with a small diameter spreading left and right inside the liver and connected to liver cells. Common hepatic duct: when the left and right hepatic ducts merge near the entrance of the liver, they extend to the outside of the liver, and they are thicker in diameter than the hepatic ducts. Cystic duct: a thin duct about 2mm in diameter that connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct, with a length of about 3-4 cm. Common bile duct: when the common hepatic duct descends and joins with the cystic duct connected to the gallbladder, it passes through the duodenum of the pancreas to the duodenal papilla. The length of the common bile duct is about 7-8 cm. Bile plays an important role as a digestive juice crucial for absorbing nutrients. It functions in the excretion and detoxification of cholesterol in the liver. Bile is produced in the liver, secreted into the intestine, and stored in the gallbladder until a meal, where it is then secreted into the small intestine for digestion. The duct is the pathway that transports bile from the liver to the small intestine. When food passes from the stomach to the duodenum, a hormone called cholecystokinin is secreted, which contracts the gallbladder to release bile into the common bile duct, simultaneously relaxing the sphincter muscle of the duodenal papilla to discharge bile into the intestine. The interior of the gallbladder duct is spiral-shaped to prevent the backflow of bile. As age increases, the elasticity and contractility of the duct tissue decrease, leading to an increase in diameter. For patients with cholesterol gallstones, a Korean-style diet may be more beneficial for preventing gallstones than a Westernized diet. It is best to eat moderately without overeating, have a balanced diet, and choose nutritionally balanced meals even when dining out. Foods rich in cholesterol such as egg yolks, squid, shrimp, offal, and eel can contribute to gallstones, so reducing the intake of these foods helps prevent gallstones. When treating gallstone disease, it is important to limit fat intake and consume adequate amounts of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Use low-fat cooking methods, choose lean meats, and maintain a daily intake of less than about 150g of meat. If a low-fat diet is maintained over time, it may be harmful to health, so gradually increasing fat intake may be necessary. Avoiding binge eating or overeating, as well as consuming stimulating foods, is recommended. Vegetables and fruits can be consumed regardless of gallstones.
