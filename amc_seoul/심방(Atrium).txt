It consists of two areas located at the upper part of the heart. The right atrium is located in front of the tricuspid valve, and the left atrium is located at the back of the heart. The heart is composed of two atria and two ventricles, with an average weight of around 300g. There is one atrium and one ventricle on each side, with the blood circulating through the body passing through the vena cava to enter the right atrium. The right atrium passes the blood to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, and from the ventricle, the blood is sent to the lungs through the pulmonary artery. Blood rich in oxygen travels through the pulmonary veins to enter the left atrium after circulating through the lungs. The left atrium passes the blood to the left ventricle through the mitral valve, and from the ventricle, the blood is forcefully pumped towards the aorta. The right atrium has a slender round shape, while the left atrium is closer to a spherical shape. The atrium is a part of the heart that is made up of muscle and is empty inside, divided into right and left sides by the atrial septum. The atrium walls are relatively thin and small compared to the ventricles due to their lesser role in contraction and dynamic function. The atrium receives venous blood from outside the heart, stores it inside the heart, and sends it to the ventricle. During the ventricles' relaxation phase, the atrium's capacity to hold blood increases, increasing the overall heart output. The exact causes of heart defects are difficult to determine. Genetic factors are often associated with congenital heart disease, where the term 'congenital' refers to the heart or blood vessels not developing normally before the baby is born. Congenital heart disease caused by genetic factors is rare, so parents should not blame themselves for it. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that occurs without specific cause and does not have symptoms or abnormal heart rate may not require treatment. When the episodes are frequent and the heart rate is fast, antiarrhythmic drugs are used to regulate heart rate, or anticoagulants are prescribed if there is no risk of bleeding. In cases of severe hypotension or congestive heart failure, after administering anticoagulants, electrical stimulation is used, with the goal of controlling heart rate in cases of chronic conditions. Above all, the most important thing to do is behavioral changes, such as quitting alcohol and smoking, and consulting with a cardiac specialist for the best treatment options.
