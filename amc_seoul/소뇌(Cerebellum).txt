The cerebellum, which is a part of the central nervous system, assists the functions of the brain to regulate voluntary movement and maintain balance. It enables coordinated movements, playing a central role in maintaining balance in our body. Located at the back of the brainstem, below the cerebellar tentorium of the brain, it lies adjacent to the brainstem, with the fourth ventricle in between. The cerebellum accounts for about 10% of the total brain volume, with more than half of the brain nerve cells densely packed in the cerebellum. Like the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the cerebellum is also divided into left and right parts. The left and right regions of the cerebellum are connected by a thin midline structure and each performs different functions. The internal structure of the cerebellum consists of the cerebellar cortex, which is a cluster of nerve cells located in the outermost layer, and cerebellar white matter composed of nerve fibers emanating from the cortex. In the deepest part of the cerebellum, there are clusters of nerve cells known as the deep cerebellar nuclei. The cerebellar vermis, which divides the cerebellar hemispheres, is divided around a central ridge, resembling a spine, without a clearly marked central part. Purkinje cells are unique nerve cells found in the cerebellar cortex, characterized by dendrites that resemble fir tree branches, narrow but extensively spread out. They develop from a simple shape to a complex form and resemble an adult-like structure by one year of age. In contrast to the cerebral hemispheres, the left cerebellum is involved in movements of the left side of the body, while the right cerebellum is involved in movements of the right side of the body. Therefore, the cerebellar hemispheres control the motor functions of the arms and legs. The cerebellum receives sensory signals indicating the positions of various body parts from the eyes, ears, joints, and muscles. It also receives motor signals from the cerebral cortex regarding how these parts should move. Neurons in the deep white matter of the cerebellum, gathered in the cerebellar deep nuclei, then transmit signals outgoing from the cerebellar cortex to the brainstem. The cerebellum integrates these two types of signals and sends motor signals to the muscles through adjacent brainstem, controlling coordination among various muscles. The cerebellar vermis in the center of the cerebellum plays this role. Through a series of processes, the cerebellum maintains posture and balance, coordinating multiple muscles for effective cooperation. The cerebellum acquires and memorizes motor actions through a sophisticated feedback system. There are two main ways in which the cerebellum controls movement: by receiving information from the inner ear's equilibrium sensory system to adjust reflex movements for body balance, gravity, and acceleration changes unconsciously, and by modulating the degree of muscle contraction and cooperation of muscles during movements executed by the skeletal muscles. Damage to these areas can result in cerebellar motor disorders, causing staggering or inability to reach out hands as intended. The cerebellum can be damaged by viruses or diseases affecting the nervous system. Viruses such as measles, Epstein-Barr, and Coxsackie can cause acute cerebellar ataxia. Children under three years of age are at the highest risk of developing ataxia, which can occur weeks after a viral infection. Ataxia caused by viral infections usually resolves spontaneously within several months without specific treatment. However, ataxia from other causes may require treatment. The use of rehabilitation aids may help in regaining motor skills, along with physical therapy, speech therapy, dietary adjustments, and symptom-specific treatments. Acute cerebellar ataxia cannot be prevented, but vaccination in children is essential to prevent viral infections that can trigger the disease.
