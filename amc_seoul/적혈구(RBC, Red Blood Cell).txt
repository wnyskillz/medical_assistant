They are red blood cells that are disk-shaped and have no nucleus, unlike other blood cells. The inside of a red blood cell is mostly composed of water and contains about 1/3 hemoglobin, as well as small amounts of sugar, enzymes, proteins, electrolytes, vitamins, and more. Mature red blood cells transport oxygen by carrying hemoglobin, which is a protein containing iron that binds to oxygen. Hemoglobin has a high affinity for oxygen, allowing it to pick up and release oxygen efficiently in the body. Red blood cells make up 45% of total blood volume and play a crucial role in oxygen transport. If the number of red blood cells in the blood decreases, it can lead to anemia. Conversely, if there is an excessive production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, it can lead to polycythemia. Symptoms of polycythemia may include dizziness, ringing in the ears, headaches, reduced vision, blood clots in the abdomen, and easy bruising, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Polycythemia can be diagnosed through various tests, including bone marrow examination, and can be treated with phlebotomy or bone marrow suppression therapy. Blood transfusions are performed in cases of chronic anemia, chronic hemorrhagic anemia, acute blood loss, low hemoglobin, sepsis, or when necessary for procedures or surgeries. Blood transfusions are not a single decision but are based on the patient's clinical condition, amount of bleeding, and replenishment capacity. Transfusion reactions such as hemolysis, infections, iron overload, and graft versus host disease may occur, and excessive transfusion may lead to fluid overload.
