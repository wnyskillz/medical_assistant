It is located in the center of the face, above the teeth and below the eye sockets. The maxilla is one of the bones that make up the skull, accounting for one-third of the lower part of the skull. At the center of the face, a pair of bones on each side merge to form the maxilla. The maxilla forms the floor of the eye sockets, the inner wall and floor of the nose, and the lower part forms the roof of the mouth. There is a structure called the alveolar process at the lower part of the maxilla where the upper teeth are fixed in place. The lower teeth are located in the alveolar processes in the mandible. The maxillary sinuses are the empty spaces inside the maxilla, called the maxillary sinuses, and are connected to the nasal cavity. Inflammation in the maxillary sinuses can cause nasal discharge to flow out of the nose when pus accumulates, known as maxillary sinusitis, a type of sinus infection. Various muscles, nerves, blood vessels, etc., are located around the maxilla, with the chin, mouth, lips, and cheeks located on the outer surface. Especially the branches of the trigeminal nerve are distributed towards the front teeth. The maxilla plays a role in stabilizing the upper teeth and allows for functions such as chewing and speaking. The nerves distributed in the maxilla area are responsible for the sensation in the upper lip and skin. The maxillary sinuses are filled with air and connected to the nasal cavity, with air circulating between them. There are many speculations about the functions of the maxilla, such as reducing the weight of the skull or cushioning impacts to the face, but they have not been definitively proven yet. If you experience pain and noise from the jaw when opening or closing the mouth, stiffness in the jaw area in the morning, habit of grinding teeth, frequent headaches or neck pain, pain around the front of the ear or jaw joint, inability to open the mouth widely, it is advisable to consider temporomandibular joint disorder and seek dental care. The cause of jaw deformity is thought to be largely congenital factors. However, it has not been determined which genetic factors are at play in this. Additionally, factors such as severe inflammation or tumors in the TMJ area, fractures, and acquired habits related to oral and facial structures can also contribute as causes. The goal of treatment for jaw deformity is ultimately to transform dysfunctional aesthetically undesirable maxilla into a functionally and aesthetically desirable shape and position. Orthodontic treatment for jaw growth adjustment is usually initiated around the 4th or 5th grade of elementary school to address growth control issues. For cases where the upper teeth are protruding, headgear can be used, and for cases where the front teeth are too far back, chin cups/face masks may be used. Orthodontic correction treatment for jaw growth adjustment should be initiated at least one year before the peak growth stage in adolescence, taking into account the individual's growth and developmental stage. A detailed examination is carried out before orthodontic treatment to confirm this. Jaw disorders are often chronically progressive and considered optional rather than necessary treatments, which means that even when there is no functional deficiency, there is still a common need for treatment from an aesthetic perspective. Therefore, the treatment goals of the patient and their guardians should harmoniously align with the direction of medical treatment professionals.
