Each foot consists of 14 metatarsal bones, with the exception of the big toe made up of two bones, the other toes, except the big toe, are made up of three bones in each toe. The toes are shorter in bone length than the fingers. Toes hold onto the ground and help us stand. Toe joints allow for toe curling upwards and toe curling downwards movements relative to the horizontal height of the toes. When cramps occur in the toes, it means muscle cramps, where the muscles of the toes contract excessively, leading to prolonged pain due to lack of relaxation. Causes include sudden intense exercise, imbalance of body fluids and electrolytes, overwork, etc. Usually, it is not a serious condition but if it occurs frequently and severely, it is advisable to seek medical attention. When muscle cramps occur in the toes, bending the toes in the opposite direction of the contraction or standing on the tips of the toes helps to relax in response to the contraction, relieving the cramp. Ingrown toenails refer to the digging of the ends of the toenails into the flesh, commonly occurring on the big toe and prone to recurrence. Wearing shoes smaller than your foot size, cutting toenails too short, or applying strong pressure to the toenails, such as athletes or soldiers or women wearing high heels, can lead to ingrown toenails. When symptoms are mild, it is advisable not to cut the toenails too short and maintain the shape of the toenails straight, but if the problem persists, one might need surgery to prevent the toenails from digging into the flesh. Especially for patients with diabetes, it is important to always be cautious and preventive regarding foot problems. One condition that causes foot pain is metatarsalgia, which causes severe pain in the front part of the foot. Wearing narrow shoes worsens the pain, while removing the shoes or resting can alleviate it. It is a condition where inflammation or compression of the nerves occurs due to repeated pressure between the metatarsal bones and often occurs in diabetes patients. Treatment involves widening the distance between the metatarsal bones to reduce nerve compression, and in some cases, local injections or surgery may be necessary. Corns on the toes are known as calluses, where the corneum thickens locally on the skin. It is caused by structural abnormalities of the feet, hard floors, or repeated pressure from shoes, creating a hard and painful area within the calluses. Removing repeated pressure is the most important, and wearing functional insoles can be helpful.
