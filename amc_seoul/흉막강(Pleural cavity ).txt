The pleura consists of two layers of membranes that wrap around the lungs, with the inner layer called visceral pleura surrounding the lungs, and the outer layer called parietal pleura surrounding the inside of the chest wall. The space between the visceral and parietal pleura is called the pleural cavity, which contains a small amount of lubricating fluid that helps with the expansion and contraction of the lungs. It is located between the surface of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall, separated by the diaphragm. The pleura is a double-layered membrane that starts at the hilum, where the trachea transitions into the lungs. The pleura is composed of the visceral pleura, which surrounds the surface of the lungs, and the parietal pleura, which covers the inside of the chest wall, with the pleural cavity between them. In a healthy individual, the pleural cavity is almost nonexistent, containing a minimal amount of pleural fluid that forms a thin film. The small amount of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity helps reduce friction during respiratory movements by allowing the lungs and chest wall to move smoothly. When inflammation occurs in the pleura, fluid may accumulate in the pleural cavity, preventing the lungs from expanding fully. This condition is called a pleural effusion, and if it becomes excessive and causes difficulty breathing, a needle can be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the fluid. Possible complications of the procedure include pain, dizziness, bleeding, pneumothorax, and pulmonary edema, but in most cases, pleural effusion can be safely removed.
