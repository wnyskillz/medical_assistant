Located between the stomach and the large intestine, the small intestine is composed of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and plays a role in digesting and absorbing food. Starting from the pyloric sphincter located on the upper right side of the abdomen, it extends to the middle of the lower abdomen and ends where the small intestine connects to the colon. The small intestine is the longest organ in our body, measuring about 6.7 to 7.6 meters from the jejunum to the ileum. The small intestine has numerous folds on its mucous membrane and villi on its surface. It is divided into three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is shaped like a "C" and has the ampulla of Vater where the common bile duct and pancreatic duct converge. It is thicker and has more blood vessel distribution compared to the ileum. The last part of the small intestine is heavily convoluted and connects to the colon. The small intestine secretes digestive enzymes to aid in digestion and absorb nutrients. In the duodenum, bicarbonate and mucus are secreted. Bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic contents coming from the stomach, while mucus protects the small intestine from the acidic gastric juice. Additionally, intestinal juice is secreted in the small intestine, which contains various digestive enzymes to aid in food digestion. Digested nutrients are absorbed through the villi in the small intestine's mucosa, and the absorbed nutrients enter the bloodstream through the villi's connection to capillaries. The small intestine also performs segmentation movements to break down the contents and peristaltic movements to propel the contents into the colon. Tumors in the small intestine are rare and often discovered late or incidentally due to the absence of specific symptoms. There are various types of small intestinal cancers, such as adenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumors, lymphomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, with adenocarcinoma being the most common form of small intestinal cancer, mainly found in the duodenum and jejunum.
