Sensory neurons, which make up the nervous system, transmit nerve impulses to the spinal cord and brain, while motor neurons transmit commands from the brain or spinal cord to muscles or glands. Neurons consist of one axon and 1-2 or more dendrites, and through structures called synapses that connect neurons, they send and receive signals, receiving and storing various information. They are distributed throughout our body. Neurons can be classified into cell body, dendrites, and axons. The cell body is the central part of a neuron, containing the nucleus and cytoplasm. Dendrites are the parts of neurons that receive signals, characterized by their branch-like structure. Neurons transmit signals and process information through neurotransmitters. Within neurons, signal transmission occurs as electrical signals, while between neurons, neurotransmission occurs through chemical signals at synapses. One example of a major neurodegenerative disease is Parkinson's disease. Neurodegenerative diseases are conditions where nerve cells degenerate, disrupting normal brain function and causing movement symptoms. Other examples include Alzheimer's and ALS. Symptoms typically include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The exact cause of these diseases is not fully understood. Many people believe that once diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, they will have to live with it for the rest of their lives and that there is no way to relieve symptoms other than treatment. However, with advancements in treatment, the survival rate has increased, and the ability to perform daily tasks has also improved, allowing for a normal life depending on the progression of the disease.
