Logging in will allow you to enjoy even more benefits. The bronchi, which connect the institution and both lungs, branch off to the left and right from the periphery of the institution. When we breathe, air moves through the bronchi to the left/right bronchus, bronchioles, lobular bronchi, segmental bronchi, sub-segmental bronchi, and finally to the terminal bronchioles. The bronchi serve not only as a passage for air, but also filter out foreign substances through mucous secretion and ciliary movement. The bronchi are located at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra and divide into left and right bronchi at the level of the 4th to 6th thoracic vertebrae. The bronchi are composed of three layers. The outer layer is made up of dense fibrous cartilage, the middle layer consists of smooth muscle, and the inner layer is lined with ciliated mucosa. In our body, the bronchi branch out to the left and right. The right bronchus is thicker, shorter, and more straight compared to the left bronchus, making it more likely for foreign substances to enter the airway through the right bronchus. The bronchi transport the inhaled air to the lungs when we breathe in, and the exhaled air moves outwards. Additionally, the mucus secretion and ciliary movement of the bronchi help eliminate bacteria, dust, and other foreign substances, and also perform immune functions. If there are abnormalities in the bronchi or lungs, phlegm may be produced. The characteristics of the phlegm can help estimate the underlying condition to some extent. Sticky, mucus-like phlegm is commonly seen in chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and asthma, while purulent phlegm resembling pus may be indicative of infectious conditions like pneumonia or lung abscess. When phlegm occurs, consulting a doctor and undergoing necessary tests can help trace the underlying cause of the condition.
