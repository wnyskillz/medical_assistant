The cortex is a structural component when differentiating between outer and inner layers in a single organ, where the outer layer is referred to as the cortex. The renal cortex refers to the outer layer of the kidney, located on the outermost part of the kidney between the renal medulla and the renal capsule. The renal cortex appears lighter in color compared to the medulla, and it is rich in renal corpuscles, proximal convoluted tubules, and blood vessels. The glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubule are located in the cortical region of the kidney, with the loop of Henle connecting the proximal convoluted tubule back to the vicinity of the cortex. The distal convoluted tubule then connects back to the medullary region, leading into the collecting duct. Glomeruli located in the deep cortex close to the medulla have elongated loops of Henle that extend towards the depth of the medulla, while those located in the superficial cortex have shorter or almost nonexistent loops. The glomerulus, a cluster of capillaries included in the renal corpuscle, filters waste products from the blood, passes them through the Bowman's capsule surrounding the glomerulus, and sends them into the nephrons through the tubules, facilitating multiple reabsorptions of glucose and amino acids. Nephrons located in the cortex without extended loops of Henle or lacking them do not participate in the reabsorption and secretion of fluids. Meanwhile, cortical nephrons with extended loops of Henle regulate water reabsorption and control the osmotic pressure within the medullary region.
