Cartilage is divided into types depending on its properties and shapes, and fibrocartilage is a type of cartilage in which white fibrous tissue and cartilaginous tissue are mixed in various proportions. It is the part where ligaments or tendons attach to the joints. Fibrocartilage is located in the form of vertebral bodies, articular disk between the patella and the knee joint (meniscus), intervertebral disk (intervertebral disk), semilunar cartilage (semilunar bone) in the temporomandibular joint or the sterno-costal joint (costosternal joint). Fibrocartilage is a hard fibrous tissue made of collagen that is strong against compression but easily torn, and is densely arranged in a intertwined state. It does not exist alone, but exists connected to hyaline cartilage or connective tissue. When distortion or compression occurs, fibrocartilage acts as a cushion to allow for a slight restricted movement and to maintain elasticity. The intervertebral disc, for example, plays a role as a cushion between bones. If there is persistent pain in the wrist, a suspicion of triangular fibrocartilage complex tear can be considered. The triangular fibrocartilage complex is a structure that functions to bend, straighten, and rotate the wrist between the wrist joint and the outer wrist bone. Chronic wrist joint pain can occur if this part is traumatized or degenerative lesions occur. It commonly occurs in people with occupations that frequently use the wrist, as well as in housewives who often perform wrist-biting exercises. It may not be visible on X-rays, causing confusion, and may be diagnosed and treated by removing the inflamed area through arthroscopy.
