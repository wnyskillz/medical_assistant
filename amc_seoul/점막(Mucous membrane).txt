It is located on the inner walls of various tissues throughout the body, such as the nasal cavity, oral cavity, urinary tract, reproductive organs, digestive tract, and respiratory system. The mucous membrane is composed of two layers called the mucous epithelium and the mucous lamina propria. In the digestive system from the esophagus to the rectum, there is an additional layer called the muscularis mucosae beyond the two layers of mucous membrane. In particular, the gastric mucosa has irregularly shaped wrinkles called gastric pits, which are covered by mucus-secreting cells to protect the gastric mucosa from being damaged by stomach acid. In the oral cavity, there are many mucus-secreting cells that provide moisture through mucus when food enters the mouth, promoting softening action and helping to maintain moisture in the oral cavity. The mucous membrane at the entrance of the nasal cavity has hairs that warm and moisturize the air before it enters the respiratory system. The mucous membrane of the airway has cilia that constantly move in the outward direction from the body to help expel foreign substances. The mucous membrane has glandular tissues like mucous glands for temperature regulation, secreting substances to prevent dryness and maintain moisture, as well as protect against foreign substance invasion. Submucosal tumors refer to tumors that occur beneath the epithelial layer of normal mucosa or in the muscle layer of the submucosa. Submucosal tumors are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, and when they are small in size, they may not cause symptoms, requiring detection through endoscopy or contrast studies, and those smaller than 1cm may not require treatment. However, when there is a high risk of malignancy or in case of malignant tumors, surgical resection may be necessary. Recently, methods to remove submucosal tumors endoscopically without open surgery are being used, but the treatment method is chosen based on the severity of the patient's condition. In dry atmospheric conditions, without proper maintenance of moisture in the airway mucosa and reduced protective mucus membranes, respiratory infections may increase. In such cases, it is important to restore the function of the airway mucosa through adequate humidity and sufficient water intake.
