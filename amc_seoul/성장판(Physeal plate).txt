The area responsible for the length growth of bones in children during their growth period around joints or the arms and legs is referred to. It is mainly located at the ends of long bones and is in the form of cartilage plates inserted between the bones. During the fetal period, all bones are made of cartilage tissue. Bone growth occurs through the deposition of calcium as this cartilage tissue develops, and the remaining cartilage portion transforms into the growth plate of the bone. As adolescence approaches, the growth plate also transforms into bone, thereby concluding the bone length growth process. It is located at both ends of our bones. The chondrocytes form the growth plate in multiple layers, with cells dividing on one side and the chondrocytes maturing into bone tissue on the other side. The chondrocytes of the growth plate divide, promoting bone length growth. The timing of growth plate closure varies by gender and individual. Typically, girls grow faster than boys, and their growth plates close earlier. In general, growth plates close around 15 years old for girls and 17 years old for boys. Growth plates are made of weaker cartilage than bones and can be damaged by external forces, leading to trauma or fractures that might cause the growth plate to close prematurely.
