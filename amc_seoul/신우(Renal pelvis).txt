The renal pelvis is a funnel-shaped space where urine produced in the kidneys collects, flows down the ureter to the bladder, and is then excreted. It is located in each kidney, between multiple renal pyramids and ureters. The collecting ducts extend over the cortex and medulla of the kidney, then converge to form the renal pelvis. The renal pelvis, which connects the substance of the kidney and the ureter, serves as a passageway for urine produced to move through the ureter. The renal pelvis is a flat funnel-shaped space, lined with transitional epithelial cells, and is covered on the outside by the adventitia and smooth muscle. The muscle layer consists of two layers and is surrounded by a lot of smooth muscle tissue. From the renal pelvis, urine is expelled through the ureters to the urethra, bladder, and eventually externally. The renal pelvis can be visualized by injecting contrast media inward for X-ray imaging, allowing the observation of its structure to detect changes in the shape of the renal pelvis or ureter, enabling the observation of kidney function and abnormalities. This space, located at the innermost part of the kidney that connects to the ureter, temporarily stores urine before it is excreted into the ureter. If there is vesicoureteral reflux caused by the backward flow of urine through the ureter, it is necessary to conduct additional tests to find the underlying cause, especially in cases of recurrent infections. For prevention, proper nutrition management and adequate hydration are recommended.
