Bones support the structure of our body, protect internal organs, and act as levers during muscle contractions to assist in movement. They are distributed throughout our entire body. Bones consist of organic components, including collagen, and inorganic components such as calcium and phosphorus. The solid inorganic components increase compressive strength to withstand weight, while the organic component collagen increases elasticity and tensile strength to withstand external pressure. The cells that make up bones include bone stem cells, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, and bone-lining cells. Our body's bones can be classified into long bones, short bones, flat bones, irregular bones, and sesamoid bones. Long bones are typically cylindrical bones with bone marrow in the center. Short bones have a similar structure to long bones but lack a bone marrow cavity. Flat bones are made up of two dense bone plates with spongy bone in between. Irregular bones refer to bones with irregular shapes, and sesamoid bones are bones located within tendons. Bones support the structure of our body, act as levers when muscles contract, and protect internal organs. They also carry out hematopoiesis through bone marrow, store and supply minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Until the age of 10, bones grow in length due to ossification, and from the age of 20, bone matrix becomes stronger until reaching maximum bone mass by the mid-30s. However, after the age of 35, bone density gradually decreases due to the activation of osteoclasts. In women, estrogen secretion, which prevents bone weakening, stops after menopause, leading to rapid bone mass loss and osteoporosis. When a bone breaks, blood vessels in the bone rupture, causing internal bleeding and forming a blood clot to stop the bleeding. Osteoblasts gather at the fractured site to start cell division and help with the recovery of the fractured area.
