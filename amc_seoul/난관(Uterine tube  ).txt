It provides a pathway for the passage of ovulated egg cells and sperm, facilitating the movement of the fertilized egg. Located long on both sides of the uterus where they meet the ovaries, the fallopian tubes are thin tube-shaped structures, with one end open like the end of a trumpet, hence the name fallopian tube. The length of a fallopian tube is about 7-14 cm, and when one side is blocked or missing, the egg cell's movement takes place normally through the remaining healthy side. The fallopian tube is not directly connected to the ovaries but has a connection point to the abdominal cavity, allowing the transportation of eggs from the abdominal and outer vaginal spaces. The fallopian tube is divided into four parts: the infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus, and uterine part. The infundibulum is the part where the tube meets the ovary, with fimbriae at the end and numerous cilia lining the inner wall. As it extends towards the uterus, the fallopian tube narrows in structure. It serves as a pathway for the egg cell released from the ovary to meet and fuse with sperm from the uterus, resulting in fertilization. The egg cell expelled from the ovary following ovulation enters the fallopian tube through the fimbriae at the end and moves through the cilia lining the inner wall. The fallopian tube aids in transporting the fertilized egg to the uterus, allowing implantation to occur. However, ectopic pregnancies mostly happen when fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus. Tubal ligation is a highly effective contraceptive method that involves blocking the fallopian tubes in women to prevent pregnancy, with an effectiveness rate of over 99%. This procedure, commonly performed via laparoscopy, involves tying or cutting the tubes with clips or rings to prevent the fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. Following the surgery, immediate contraception is achieved, but until it is confirmed through testing that the fallopian tubes are completely closed, an alternative form of contraception should be used. While tubal ligation reversal is possible, the chances of pregnancy decrease by about 50%, and the risk of ectopic pregnancy increases post-reversal. Therefore, it is recommended to carefully consider future pregnancy plans before deciding on tubal ligation.
