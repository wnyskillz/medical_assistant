It receives information about internal and external changes in the body through peripheral nerves, sends it to the brain, where it is analyzed and integrated, and then sends it back to different parts through the peripheral nerves. It acts as a conduit for excitement transmission and functions as a reflex center. The spinal cord is located within the vertebral canal formed by the vertebrae, extending to the first lumbar vertebra in adults as it does not grow with the spine. The spinal cord is housed within the hard vertebral bones and protected by three layers of meninges: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Particularly, the pia mater containing cerebrospinal fluid provides additional protection for the spinal cord from external shocks. The meninges are layers of membranes covering and protecting the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord is made up of gray matter, forming an H-shape where cell bodies of neurons cluster and white matter consisting of nerve fibers that transmit sensory information received at a sensory organ to the brain. Thirty-one pairs of nerve bundles exit the spinal cord at each vertebral level, dividing into anterior (motor) and posterior (sensory) roots. The nerves branching off above the spinal cord connect to the upper body, arms, and hands, while nerves branching off below connect to the pelvis, thighs, calves, and feet. Peripheral nerves branch further from the spinal cord into the skin, muscles, blood vessels, and bones from head to toe. The spinal cord serves as a conduit between the brain and the peripheral nervous system, transmitting sensory information from the body's extremities to the brain through the posterior root and sending commands from the brain to the extremities through the anterior root. It also acts as a reflex center not requiring brain control, eliciting immediate responses such as knee jerk reflex, withdrawal reflex, and infantile micturition reflex. Damage to the spinal cord can lead to loss of sensation or motor function depending on the location of the injury, causing paralysis or sensory loss. Functional loss is greater with injuries higher up on the spinal cord. Damage to the lower part of the spinal cord affects the functionality of the lower body, while the upper body remains unaffected. Spinal cord injuries can also disrupt the autonomic nervous system, impacting functions such as blood pressure, temperature regulation, digestion, sexual function, and bladder control. Some nerve fibers within the spinal cord transmit sensory information to motor neurons rapidly via short neural pathways without involving the brain, known as spinal reflexes. Types of spinal reflexes include stretch reflexes, which cause the immediate contraction of skeletal muscles, and withdrawal reflexes, which involve flexing or withdrawing a body part to avoid painful stimuli. Spinal anesthesia involves injecting an anesthetic agent into the space between the spinal cord and the meninges within the range of the second lumbar vertebra to the lower border of the sacrum. This type of anesthesia numbs the lower part of the body controlled by the spinal cord, allowing procedures below the belly button to be carried out without the need for general anesthesia. Side effects include the sympathetic nervous system being affected, potentially causing a drop in blood pressure, and prolonged anesthesia in some cases.
