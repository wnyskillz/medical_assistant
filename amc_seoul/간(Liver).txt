The liver is made up of four lobes and receives blood supply from the hepatic artery and portal vein. It performs various functions such as digestion, hormone metabolism, detoxification, and antimicrobial functions, making it one of the most important organs in the human body. When dividing the abdomen into quadrants, it is located in the upper right part below the diaphragm. The liver is dark reddish-brown in color, with a smooth surface, and weighs about 1.2kg. The liver can be classified into four lobes: the right lobe, left lobe, quadrate lobe, and caudate lobe. Unlike other organs, the liver receives blood supply through two methods: it receives oxygenated arterial blood from the hepatic artery and nutrient-rich venous blood from the portal vein. The liver plays a vital role in metabolic processes in the body. It transforms the foods we consume into essential nutrients for various tissues, recycles waste products, stores glycogen in the form of glucose, and synthesizes proteins like albumin involved in blood clotting. It also produces bile acids to aid in fat digestion and elimination. When there is an excess intake of carbohydrates, the liver converts them into fats for storage and later energy production when needed. The liver produces about 1L of bile per day, which is stored in the gallbladder and excreted into the small intestine. The liver synthesizes and releases essential substances needed for the body to function properly into the bloodstream. It stores vitamins A, D, B12, and minerals like iron, copper, and zinc. As hormones are metabolized in the liver, any dysfunction in liver function can lead to hormonal imbalances. The liver also acts as a detoxifying agent, breaking down harmful substances that enter the body. Kupffer cells in the liver play a role in processing foreign substances in the bloodstream, converting ammonia into urea to be excreted in urine. It also converts harmful substances into harmless ones to be excreted through urine. The liver plays a crucial role in metabolizing various drugs and alcohol. It stores about 13% of the body's total blood volume. A common test to assess liver function is measuring AST/ALT (GOT/GPT) levels in the blood. These enzymes are primarily found in the liver and increase when there is liver damage, making them useful markers for detecting liver damage. However, elevated levels of AST/ALT may not always indicate liver damage, as these enzymes are present in other organs like the heart, skeletal muscles, and kidneys as well. Taking a variety of medications or health supplements can lead to elevated AST/ALT levels, so it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before making decisions regarding medication or supplement intake. Additionally, liver function can be evaluated by measuring serum albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time in the blood.
