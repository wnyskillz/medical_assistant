It surrounds the eye in the eye socket. It is formed by the fusion of some of the 7 bones located in the face and has a concave shape to allow the eye to enter. The concave space has a volume of 30ml, and muscles, nerves, and blood vessels connected to the eye pass through it connecting to the eye socket. The sinuses are located around the eye socket, and the inside wall of the eye socket has a tear duct that connects to a tear sac and continues to the nasal cavity. The eye socket, which is the bone around the eye, protects the eye and eye muscles inside from spreading damage to the surrounding area, but this very thin and delicate bone can easily be damaged by minor impacts. If the bones around the eye (orbit) are fractured due to impact, the eye's connective tissue, eye fat, and eye muscles move toward the sinus cavity on the side of the nose through the thinly broken bones. This can cause enophthalmos, where the eye appears sunken. If the fracture of the eye socket is not treated promptly, secondary enophthalmos may occur. Although surgery can restore it to some extent, there may still be some differences compared to the normal eye.
