It is located between the pelvis and the knee and is surrounded by a hard outer cortical bone (compact bone), with little trabecular bone inside, making it hollow like a long tube. The ends of the femur have trabecular bone, making healing of fractures easier if they occur at the ends, but the shaft of the femur has little trabecular bone, making it difficult for the bone to heal properly in case of a fracture. In particular, the large trochanter at the end of the femur is located below the femoral neck to supply abundant blood to the neck area. If the blood supply in this area is disrupted, avascular necrosis of the femoral head can occur. The upper part of the femur meets the pelvis to form the hip joint, and the lower part forms the knee joint with the tibia and patella. Most of the femur, excluding the knee joint, is surrounded by muscles. It supports the weight transmitted through the pelvis and hip joint and enables the leg to move. Femoral neck fractures are a common type of fracture in osteoporosis patients when they fall, especially in the elderly. Osteoporosis is observed in around 40% of women over the age of 60 and men over the age of 80, and even a slight external force can cause fractures in those with osteoporosis. In particular, the elderly have reduced balance sensitivity and are prone to hip fractures when they fall and hit their buttocks, losing balance.
