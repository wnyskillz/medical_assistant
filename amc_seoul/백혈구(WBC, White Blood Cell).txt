White blood cells, which make up less than 1% of total blood volume, are cells that protect the body against infections and foreign substances in the bloodstream. They are distributed throughout the body's blood. White blood cells account for less than 1% of the total blood volume and are the only complete cells in the blood with a nucleus and organelles. They are generated in the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cells and, when mature, are released into the bloodstream to perform immune functions to protect the body against infections and foreign substances. They are composed of five different types of cells: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Neutrophils account for 40-70% of white blood cells and respond rapidly to bacterial and fungal infections and all inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils are involved in parasitic infections and allergic reactions. Basophils secrete histamine to dilate blood vessels at inflammatory sites in response to allergic reactions and antigens. Lymphocytes assist in removing microbes, antigens, and other foreign invaders by binding to them and escorting them out of the body, consisting of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. Monocytes perform phagocytosis on external materials in tissues and their numbers increase during chronic infections. Tests are conducted to diagnose conditions suspected of causing problems in white blood cell production, infections, or to monitor bone marrow function and treatment status. The function of white blood cells is to phagocytize and digest bacteria or foreign substances that have invaded cells to detoxify them. They function exclusively in the bloodstream and move through blood vessels to organs requiring inflammation or immune responses. Production of white blood cells accelerates in tissues damaged or infected by bacteria or viruses to facilitate phagocytosis. A white blood cell count over 10,000/mmÂ³ indicates leukocytosis. Conversely, abnormally low white blood cell counts are known as leukopenia. Leukemias originate from developing immature white blood cells in the bone marrow and are excessively produced in the peripheral blood. They are unable to fulfill the functions of white blood cells, making individuals highly susceptible to infections and potential fatalities. When white blood cell counts drop below 3000, individuals become extremely vulnerable to infections, putting them at risk even for mild illnesses like sore throats or diarrhea. All cancers constitute approximately 8% of cases and are more common in children. Chemotherapy can reduce white blood cell production in the bone marrow, leading to decreased white blood cell counts. As a result, infections can occur anywhere in the body at an accelerated rate, posing significant risks. Generally, white blood cell counts start dropping 1-2 weeks after starting chemotherapy, reaching a minimum around 2-3 weeks before gradually recovering to normal levels by 3-4 weeks. Precautions to prevent infections include frequent handwashing, avoiding crowded places, and being cautious not to injure the skin. For individuals with decreased white blood cell counts, dietary plans should be considered based on personal preferences, medical conditions, and appetite, increasing protein intake and considering easily digestible foods and cooking methods. It is advisable to consume small meals throughout the day. When oral issues are present, avoid rough-surfaced foods and hot or heavily spiced foods. Adequate vitamin intake is necessary, and in some cases, antiemetic drugs or folic acid supplementation might be required.
