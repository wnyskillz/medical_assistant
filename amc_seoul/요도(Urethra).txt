The female urethra is located below the pubic symphysis and attached to the anterior wall of the vagina, while the male urethra extends from the lower part of the bladder to the tip of the penis. The length of the urethra varies by gender, with females having a length of about 3-4 cm, and males about 20 cm. The male urethra is composed of the prostatic urethra, membrane urethra, posterior urethra including membranous urethra and spongy urethra, and the female urethra consists of the anterior urethra close to the urethral opening and the posterior urethra close to the bladder. The internal urethral sphincter muscle contracts at the junction of the bladder and urethra to close off the urethra when urine does not pass through, and the external urethral sphincter muscle at the bottom of the pelvis controls urination voluntarily. In females, the urethra primarily functions as a pathway for expelling urine from the bladder. In males, the urethra not only serves the function of urine excretion but also plays a role in ejaculating semen as part of the reproductive system. However, because urine and sperm do not pass through simultaneously, during ejaculation when sperm enters the prostatic urethra from the ejaculatory duct, the bladder sphincter muscle contracts to prevent urine from entering the urethra while also blocking the sperm from entering the bladder, allowing these two functions to coordinate. Females are more susceptible to urinary tract infections due to their shorter urethra compared to males. A urinary tract infection occurs when bacteria enter the urethra and cause inflammation from the bladder to the kidneys through the urinary tract. Normally, bacteria are washed away by urination or eliminated by the body's immune response, but infections can occur when the immune system is compromised, during sexual intercourse, diabetes, and other factors. To prevent urinary tract infections, it is recommended to wash the genital area before and after sexual intercourse, drink 3-5 glasses of water daily, practice safe sex using condoms, wipe from front to back, and not withhold urination when feeling a sense of urgency.
