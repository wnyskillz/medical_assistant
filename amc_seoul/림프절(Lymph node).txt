Located in the middle of the lymphatic vessels spread throughout the body, lymph nodes are pouch-shaped structures that produce immune cells called lymphocytes, which help remove foreign substances like bacteria that enter the lymphatic vessels, thereby playing a role in protecting the body. Lymph nodes exist in a considerably large form in the axilla, groin, and neck, with thousands of lymph nodes located throughout the body connected to the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes come in various shapes and sizes, but most are usually less than 2.5cm in length and resemble the kidney. The outer part of the lymph node is called the cortex, where a specific type of lymphocyte called B cells that produce antibodies gathers at the central area of the cortex. The rest of the cortex contains T cells that monitor immune responses circulating through the blood, lymph nodes, and the lymphatic system. In the core of the lymph node called the medulla, there are macrophages involved in phagocytosis. Lymph flows into the lymph node through the afferent lymphatic vessels at a very slow pace, passing through the lymph node and exiting through the efferent lymphatic vessels. As lymph passes through the lymph node, lymphocytes inside the lymph node react to foreign substances and remove them, while macrophages play a role in destroying bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances. If the lymph node filters out foreign substances, for example in acute inflammation, the lymph node may become swollen. The most commonly used method to indicate the staging of cancer is the TNM system, where T stands for Tumor size and extent of invasion in the organ where cancer originated, N stands for Node referring to lymph nodes and indicates how much lymph node metastasis has occurred around the organ where cancer developed, and M stands for Metastasis indicating whether there is metastasis to other organs outside the original organ where cancer originated. The meaning of staging varies depending on which organ has cancer, and staging does not necessarily indicate the absolute prognosis of cancer. There are hundreds of lymph nodes around the neck, and when they become enlarged due to infection, malignant tumors, etc., it is called cervical lymphadenopathy. In such cases, various conditions can be suspected, such as tonsillitis, upper respiratory tract infections, lymphadenitis for adults, and for children, viral infections like measles, mumps, or rubella that can cause enlargement of neck lymph nodes. Additionally, non-specific chronic cervical lymphadenitis, acute necrotizing lymphadenitis, suppurative lymphadenitis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, lymphoma, and other conditions exist, therefore, it is advisable to consult with medical professionals for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
