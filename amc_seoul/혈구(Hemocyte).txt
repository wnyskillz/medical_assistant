Blood cells are generated in the bone marrow and play a role in supplying oxygen and nutrients to cells as they circulate through our bodies. They exist within the circulating blood throughout our bodies. Blood cells are composed of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells have a nucleus and are mobile. White blood cells are composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. They are the smallest blood cells and have a structure without a nucleus. They defend against bacteria and fungal infections and perform the initial response in all inflammatory reactions. They assist in removing foreign invaders such as microbes and antigens from the body and are composed of T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. They perform phagocytic actions against external substances, are involved in parasitic infections and allergic reactions, and secrete histamine in response to allergic reactions and antigens, causing inflammation. If there is a shortage or impairment in the function of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues of our bodies can lead to anemia. Anemia includes iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia, and hemolytic anemia, with iron deficiency anemia being the most common. Iron deficiency anemia occurs when there is a lack of iron essential for making hemoglobin, resulting in the bone marrow's inability to produce red blood cells. This can be corrected by consuming iron. White blood cells can increase during bacterial infections, inflammation, leukemia, trauma, vigorous exercise, or stress, and decrease during chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or autoimmune diseases. If platelets fail to function properly, uncontrolled bleeding can become problematic. One disease that can occur as a result is immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). ITP is a bleeding disorder caused by autoimmune platelet destruction, resulting in symptoms such as easy bruising, petechiae, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, anemia, fatigue, etc. ITP can be treated with steroids or immunoglobulins, and in some cases, splenectomy may be performed to remove the destroyed platelets.
