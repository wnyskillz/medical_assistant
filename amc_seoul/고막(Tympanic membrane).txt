It is located at the end of the outer ear canal. It consists of a thin and transparent conical membrane attached to the end of the external auditory canal, composed of the skin layer, fibrous layer, and mucosal layer. The external and middle ear form a boundary with the eardrum as the reference point. The eardrum functions as a vibrating plate that vibrates sound waves transmitted through the external auditory canal, amplifies sound, regulates the vibration of the eardrum caused by sound waves, converts it into lymphatic vibrations in the inner ear, and transmits sound waves to the cochlear duct in the inner ear. In addition to transmitting sound waves, it also protects the middle ear. In cases of acute bacterial otitis media leading to a perforated eardrum, pus or fluid may come out through the eardrum. It can occur due to trauma caused by sudden changes in pressure inside and outside the eardrum, resulting in symptoms such as ear pain, bleeding, pus discharge, difficulty hearing faint sounds. If a perforated eardrum is suspected, it is advisable to avoid water entering the ear and seek medical attention as soon as possible. In some cases, natural healing can occur, but if it becomes chronic, hearing loss can occur, and if more than half of the eardrum is damaged, a tympanoplasty may be necessary. When a hole occurs in the eardrum, you may experience pain, bleeding, tinnitus, hearing loss, and dizziness. If the size of the perforation is small, natural healing may occur, but if the damage is more than 50% of the eardrum or lasts for more than 2 months, surgery may be required if the inner ear is damaged inside the eardrum.
