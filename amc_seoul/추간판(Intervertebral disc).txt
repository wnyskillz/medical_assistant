It plays a role in connecting the vertebrae and relieving the movement and shock of the spine as a strong connective tissue between the vertebrae. It is located between the vertebrae in our body. The disk consists of a tough outer layer called the fibrous ring and a jelly-like nucleus in the center. In the central part of the disk, there are no blood vessels, and oxygen, nutrients, and waste products are exchanged along the surrounding body fluid. It plays a role in connecting the vertebrae and acting as the center of movement of the spine, as well as relieving the shock of the spine. As you age, degeneration may occur, or if the nucleus within the disk escapes through a tear in the fibrous ring due to trauma, it can compress the surrounding nerves and cause an inflammatory response, which is called a herniated disk. In the case of a herniated disk, you may experience pain, numbness, a tingling sensation, and if the escaped disk compresses a motor nerve, it can lead to reduced muscle strength and, in severe cases, paralysis. The symptoms of a herniated disk can vary depending on which nerve the escaped disk is pressing on. The most common forms of herniated disks are lumbar herniated disks and cervical herniated disks, with lumbar herniated disks being characterized by sciatica and cervical herniated disks by shoulder pain. Treatment for a herniated disk can include drug therapy, physical therapy, exercise therapy, epidural injections, nerve root blocks, non-surgical treatments, and surgical treatments.
