Above the elbow is called the upper arm, and below is called the forearm with the elbow as the center. The arm plays an important role in the movement of the hand. It is located between our body's shoulders and wrists. The arm is divided into the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm. Arm muscles in the upper arm include the biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis, triceps brachii, and anconeus, which mainly act on the elbow joint to perform the movement of the upper arm. Muscles located in the forearm include flexors and extensors as well as pronators and supinators, primarily acting on the wrist joint to involve movements of the hand and fingers. Nerves in the arm include the ulnar nerve, median nerve, and radial nerve. The arm plays an important role in the movement of the hand through various muscles and joints. When experiencing symptoms of tingling in the arm due to cubital tunnel syndrome, it can be suspected in the elbow joint. Cubital tunnel syndrome occurs due to compression of the ulnar nerve behind the elbow, leading to tingling and pain in the forearm, palm, hand, ring, and pinky fingers. This can occur from repetitive irritation of the ulnar nerve or prolonged pressure on the elbow. If the nerve is compressed for an extended period, it can lead to weakness in the hand muscles, making delicate movements difficult and causing deformity in the fingers, requiring treatment.
