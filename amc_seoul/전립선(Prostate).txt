It is situated below the bladder, fixed to the bladder neck above, bordered by the urogenital diaphragm below, fixed to the puboprostatic ligaments in the front, and deeply located in the pelvic cavity. The prostate is enveloped by connective tissue abundant in veins and elastic fibers, and the normal weight of the adult prostate is about 15-20g, with a length of approximately 4cm. The prostate is an organ consisting of glandular tissue and surrounding fibromuscular tissue, arranged in a concentric circle around the urethra, with 15-30 ducts connecting to the prostatic urethra. The prostate produces a portion (30%) of seminal fluid, which provides nutrients to sperm and enhances their motility. Prostatic fluid, rich in citric acid and zinc, functions as an antiseptic by killing bacteria in the urogenital tract, preventing urinary tract infections. As men age, they begin to develop benign prostatic hyperplasia within the prostate. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a very common condition that more than 50% of men over 60 will experience. As the prostate surrounds the bladder outlet, when benign prostatic hyperplasia occurs, this area becomes compressed, narrowing the urethra and causing a decrease in urine flow. This may result in frequent nighttime urination and longer time spent urinating than before. Initially presenting with mild symptoms, if left untreated, it can be difficult to restore bladder function and may lead to impaired kidney function, necessitating appropriate treatment. Benign prostatic hyperplasia can be treated with medication, procedures, or surgical intervention.
