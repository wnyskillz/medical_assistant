It senses taste, moves food, and produces sound through various movements. Located on the floor of the mouth and protruding into the mouth, the tongue is approximately 10cm in length. The tongue is divided into root, body, and tip parts. The root part has minimal movement, with the body part mainly moving inside the mouth, accounting for about 2/3 of the whole tongue. There are lymph nodes in the tongue root, called lingual tonsils. The tongue, made of muscles, is divided into outer and inner parts. The outer part contributes to the movement and shape of the tongue, while the inner part changes to an appropriate shape when the tongue moves. A muscle called the hyoglossus muscle is attached to the underside of the tongue, allowing for various movements due to the different muscles connected to the tongue. The surface of the tongue is covered with mucous membranes, and particularly, thin mucosal projections called papillae are widely distributed on the roof and side edges of the mouth. Different types of papillae are located on different parts of the tongue, each with taste buds that can sense flavors. The tongue can be moved in various ways due to the muscle tissue around it, such as curling it round or lifting the tip upwards, aiding in mixing food evenly and swallowing. Additionally, by freely moving the tongue, it can create sound by passing air through it. This is achieved through the coordinated action of various parts of the mouth, including the tongue, lips, and oral cavity, enabling the production of specific sounds and pronunciations. The numerous papillae on the surface of the tongue house taste buds, allowing for the perception of taste sensations such as sweet, bitter, salty, and sour, with each taste being slightly different on different parts of the tongue, although recent opinions suggest a more complex interaction. When the mouth becomes dry and the evaporation exceeds salivary secretion, causing dryness in the mouth, even resulting in a cracked tongue. Dry oral cells are vulnerable to external harmful substances, leading to inflammation, while a cracked tongue can easily tear and bleed with movement. The drying of the tongue inside the mouth can be due to persistent sympathetic nerve activity in the body, or as a result of oral candidiasis infection causing various proliferation.
