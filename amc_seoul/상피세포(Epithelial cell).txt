The membrane tissue that makes up the layers of cells covering the inside and outside of our body and tissues is called epithelium, and the cells that make up this tissue are called epithelial cells. It covers the internal surfaces of the body's internal organs. Epithelium is composed of cells that cover the surface and are exposed outward, surrounding the internal cavities of various organs and the surface of the body. The cells that make it up are divided into various types according to their shapes. Epithelial cells are structures that continue to grow through cell division in places such as the skin, nails, hair, etc. They perform different functions depending on their location, and their shapes can vary depending on their functions. They are responsible for functions such as olfaction in the nose, taste in the tongue, vision in the eyes, and sensation of touch in the skin. Epithelial cells in the digestive system absorb substances, absorbing nutrients in the small intestine and absorbing water in the large intestine. There are also epithelial cells that play roles in reproduction and transportation. In the digestive system and endocrine glands, they also secrete fluids such as digestive juices and hormones necessary for the body. They perform different functions depending on their distribution and grow at different rates. If the epithelial cell layer of the mucous membrane is damaged, it can cause inflammation to persist and lead to chronic inflammatory diseases. The recovery of the damaged epithelial cell layer plays a very important role in restoring inflammation.
