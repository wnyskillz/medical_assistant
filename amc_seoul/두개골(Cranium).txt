The skull is divided into fifteen types of bones, totaling 23 separate bones. The junction where these bones meet and connect is called a suture. The skull is divided into the cranial bones that surround the brain and the facial bones that form the face. The cranial bones (cranium) consist of six types of bones, totaling 8 bones. The types of bones are the frontal bone, parietal bone, temporal bone, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, and ethmoid bone. The facial bones consist of nine types of bones, totaling 15 bones. The types of bones are the nasal bone, lacrimal bone, vomer, palatine bone, zygomatic bone, inferior nasal concha, maxilla, mandible, and hyoid bone. All cranial bones are connected by sutures, forming joints that cannot move except the mandible, which is attached to the cranium by a joint that allows for movement. The skull is the most important bone that protects the brain. The cranial bones protect the delicate brain tissue prone to injury, while the facial bones allow for movement of the eyes and facial muscles. Deformities in the skull can affect the brain within. They can cause compression of the cerebral cortex or deformation of brain tissue, affecting brain function. Decompressive craniectomy, which removes portions of the skull to reduce increased intracranial pressure in conditions like cerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or cerebral edema, can be performed. By removing parts of the skull to expand the limited space and lower the elevated intracranial pressure, this surgical procedure improves blood flow to the brain, primarily used in conditions such as brain hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and cerebral edema.
