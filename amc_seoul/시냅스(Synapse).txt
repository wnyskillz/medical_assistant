The gap between the end of the axon, which conducts stimuli from a neuron's cell body outward, and where neurotransmitters pass between neurons is called a synapse. Synapses are distributed where neurons are found throughout the body, mainly in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, as well as in ganglia. There are over trillions of synapses among one hundred billion neurons, and the human brain is estimated to have been born with 600 billion to 1,000 billion neurons which include hundreds of trillions of synapses. Synapses serve as the area where neurons or cells come into contact to transmit information, with presynaptic neurons sending signals and postsynaptic neurons receiving them. Signal transmission at synapses flows in a single direction from neurons to target cells, representing the information processing capacity of the nervous system. Synapses play a crucial role in processing and integrating information in our bodies, connecting the series of processes involved in stimulating sensory organs, reacting, and forming memories. Depending on the method of signal transmission, synapses are classified into electrical synapses and chemical synapses. Electrical synapses have a simple structure where ions are directly transferred from one cell to another, acting bidirectionally. Meanwhile, in chemical synapses, neurotransmitters are released from vesicles at the presynaptic cleft, and upon reception by receptors at the postsynaptic side, they facilitate either excitation or inhibition of information transfer. Chemical synapses function unidirectionally from presynaptic neurons to postsynaptic neurons, with specific regions of response to stimuli being localized. Some neurotransmitters that pass through synapses include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and glycine.
