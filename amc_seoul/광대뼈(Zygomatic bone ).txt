The bone has four surfaces where nerves pass through the spaces between bones and muscles attach. There is an empty space called the maxillary sinus inside the zygomatic bone. As one of the skull bones, it serves to protect the face, with a distinctive shape that gives it its own characteristics.

Eastern and Western standards of beauty are different because their looks differ.

These differences are reflected in plastic surgery trends, with zygomatic enhancement surgeries being popular in the West and zygomatic reduction surgeries being common in the East.
