The large intestine consists of the cecum, colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. It absorbs moisture from undigested food, stores waste, and expels it from the body in the form of feces. The large intestine starts at the right iliac fossa in the pelvic region, goes up through the upper abdomen, crosses over to the left abdomen, and then descends down to the rectum where it connects to the anus. The intestinal wall is divided into four layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscular layer, and serosa. The large intestine is classified into cecum, colon, and rectum. The cecum is the part that connects the end of the colon to the ascending colon, and it has a tail-like structure called the vermiform appendix. It can be further classified into the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon refers to the portion from the sigmoid colon to the rectum. The large intestine absorbs moisture, synthesizes some vitamins including vitamin B and vitamin K, and processes remaining food after digestion to form feces for excretion. It is known that excessive consumption of meat, especially red meat, increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Red meat is high in fat content, often cooked at high temperatures, and processed, which can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances called heterocyclic amines in the large intestine or during the cooking process, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer. Therefore, for the prevention of colorectal cancer, it is better to consume white meat instead of red meat, and it is recommended to use cooking methods such as boiling and steaming rather than direct grilling.
