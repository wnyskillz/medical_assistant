When we have a bowel movement, the anal sphincter relaxes around the anus so that the feces can be expelled. Normally, the anal sphincter remains contracted to prevent leakage of feces. If the function of this sphincter weakens, fecal incontinence can occur. The location of the anus can be defined anatomically and surgically. Anatomically, it refers to a length of about 2.5-3 cm from the anal verge where the anus meets the skin to the dentate line. Surgically, it refers to a length of about 4-5 cm from the anal margin to the anorectal junction, where the rectum abruptly narrows. The internal mucosa of the anus is composed of squamous epithelial cells that are pink in color on the upper part and stratified squamous epithelial cells that are purple in color on the lower part. The anal margin is lined with squamous epithelial cells and merges with the outer skin. The anus has sphincter muscles, consisting of an internal anal sphincter controlled by the autonomic nervous system, and an external anal sphincter controlled by the somatic nerves. The internal anal sphincter relaxes during defecation and gas expulsion, allowing the anus to open, but remains closed at rest without conscious effort. The external anal sphincter can be voluntarily contracted and relaxed to control defecation and gas expulsion consciously. The anal levator muscles anchor the anus to the anterior pubic bone and posterior coccyx to support and maintain the position of the anus, preventing fecal leakage. Near the anal opening, there is a dentate line where the area above is less sensitive to pain under autonomic nerve control, while the area below is more pain-sensitive under somatic nerve control. Therefore, internal hemorrhoids above the dentate line are usually painless, while external hemorrhoids below can be very painful. The anal crypts around the dentate line secrete lubricating mucus to facilitate smooth bowel movements. If bacteria infect these anal crypts, it can lead to anal fissures and perianal abscesses. The anus functions to expel feces from the rectum out of the body. When feces accumulate in the rectum, we sense the urge to defecate and eventually pass the feces through the anus when the anal sphincter relaxes. Normally, the anal sphincter remains contracted to prevent fecal leakage. An anal fissure refers to a lump formed by dilated veins around the anus. Anal fissures can develop due to prolonged sitting, constipation, excessive straining, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, or pregnancy. Internal hemorrhoids may cause bleeding during defecation and anal protrusion, while external hemorrhoids commonly present with pain, itching around the anus, and discharge. Mild symptoms can be managed with sitz baths, increased fluid intake, and dietary fiber, but severe cases may require surgical treatment.
