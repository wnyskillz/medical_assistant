The inner medulla secretes adrenaline that constricts blood vessels and raises blood pressure, while the outer cortex secretes adrenal cortical hormones. It is located above the kidneys on both sides. The adrenal gland weighs about 5g, with a size of about 3-5cm, the right adrenal gland is triangular in shape, and the left adrenal gland resembles a crescent shape. The adrenal gland is made up of cortex and medulla. The adrenal gland plays a role in producing the hormones our body needs. The medulla of the adrenal gland secretes catecholamine hormones like epinephrine and norepinephrine to help us respond in emergency situations. The cortex of the adrenal gland secretes hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens to help maintain our body's metabolism and homeostasis. Hormone secretion in the adrenal gland is regulated by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the brain. Among them, the hypothalamus plays a central role in regulating adrenal hormone secretion. The pituitary gland receives signals from the hypothalamus to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone, which stimulates adrenal hormone secretion, leading to the secretion of various hormones from the adrenal gland. Excessive secretion of adrenal cortical hormones can lead to Cushing's syndrome, while insufficient secretion may result in Addison's disease. Diseases affecting the adrenal medulla can cause pheochromocytoma, which can be a cause of secondary hypertension.
