The color and size of the nipple vary slightly from person to person. They are located on both sides of the chest, in the center of each breast. The nipple refers to the pigmented rounded skin around the nipple. The reason why the color of the nipple differs from the rest of the breast is because of the presence of milk ducts in the pigmented area. The color of the nipple is determined by the amount of brown and red pigments, genetically predetermined. Nipple colors can range from light yellow to dark black, with lighter skin having lighter colored nipples and darker skin having darker colored ones. Additionally, hormone changes during menstruation, medication, and aging also affect the color. The most significant color changes in the nipple often occur during pregnancy. After childbirth, the nipple color may return to its original color, but it can also persist. Nipple size varies among individuals, ranging from 1.5cm to 6cm in diameter. Adult women tend to have larger nipples compared to men or prepubescent girls, particularly women who breastfeed or have larger breasts. Most nipples are rounded, but some may be oval-shaped. The small bumps on the surface of the nipple are called Montgomery glands, which secrete sebum to protect the nipple and areola during breastfeeding, helping withstand friction and pressure. When nursing, the baby should latch deeply onto the areola, not just the nipple. Teaching the proper way to breastfeed can help prevent issues with nipple size or shape. In cases of breast loss due to reasons like breast cancer or accidents, reconstructive surgery can be performed to restore the breast. This surgery not only reconstructs the breast but also the removed nipple and areola. Initially, breast reconstruction is done using the skin of the breast to create the nipple, followed by tattooing to reconstruct the areola, considering color and shape. Nipple reconstruction is usually done twice to achieve symmetry on both sides.
