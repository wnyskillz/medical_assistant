Blood circulates throughout the body through the arteries and comes out through the veins. During this process, some of the body fluid remains between the cells, creating interstitial fluid. When this interstitial fluid exits through the lymphatic capillaries, it is called lymph. Lymph circulates throughout the body via lymphatic vessels, supplying nutrients to individual cells, absorbing waste, and then re-entering the bloodstream through the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct junction. Lymph is distributed throughout our body. Lymph is a light yellow liquid, containing less protein and more fat than blood, and it is rich in lymphocytes and white blood cells. Lymphocytes play a role in the immune response by defending the body against bacteria, viruses, and other invaders. Lymphedema commonly occurs after breast cancer surgery. This phenomenon is when lymph fluid that circulates from the breast and arm gets blocked in the arm due to the removal or damage of the underarm lymph nodes through surgery or radiation therapy. To prevent lymphedema, it is important to keep the arm elevated above the heart while lying down and avoid heavy lifting on the swollen area. Tight clothing, accessories, blood pressure measurements, and blood draws should be avoided on the affected limb.
