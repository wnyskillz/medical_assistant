It is located at the front of the vulva and adjacent to the urethra. It is the female equivalent of the male penis and is a small bump-shaped organ located in front of the urethra. The clitoris can be divided into the glans, body (corpus), root (crus), and foreskin. The size of the clitoral glans is about 6-8mm, with many nerve tissues located there. It is erectile like the male penis but does not become as rigid. The external portion of the clitoris includes the glans and foreskin, but the actual clitoris extends inside the clitoral hood. The clitoral body is curved like a boomerang, extending from the inside of the clitoral hood to the pubic bone, measuring about 10cm in length. The clitoral glans protrudes slightly at the tip of the external genitalia, covered by a thin foreskin similar to the male penis. The clitoral foreskin may cover part or all of the glans, which is the most sensitive area for women. When sexually aroused, blood flow increases to the clitoris, causing it to become enlarged and rigid, similar to an erection. Unlike the male penis with around 2,500 nerves, the clitoris has over 8,000 nerves, making it more sensitive to stimulation. Since the clitoris is not prominently visible externally, even when erect, it is not very noticeable. The clitoral foreskin protects the clitoral glans from sexual or pubic bone stimulation and helps maintain lubrication by secreting sebum. If the clitoris is covered or hidden by nearby skin folds, satisfaction in sexual activity may decrease, and surgery can be performed to bring the clitoris out of the prepuce tissue for a more fulfilling sex life.
