It is located between the gums and the teeth. Alveolar bone, which surrounds the roots of the teeth, is located, and as many alveoli are positioned in a horseshoe shape in the space between the teeth and the alveolar bone. Between the alveoli and the tooth roots (dental pulp), a connective tissue called the periodontal ligament connects the two parts. The alveolus closely resembles the shape of the dental pulp and together forms the alveolar arch with the entire tooth. When a tooth is extracted, the alveolus, the space between the tooth and the jaw, disappears. It plays a role in anchoring the teeth to the surrounding tissues such as the alveolar bone.
