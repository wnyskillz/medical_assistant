They are located where the upper arms and torso meet, spreading widely to the front and back. The muscles that make up the shoulder joint from the shoulder blade (scapula) include the deltoid muscle, supraspinatus muscle, infraspinatus muscle, teres minor muscle, and subscapularis muscle, all of which are firmly attached to the shoulder blade through tendons. They are located at the point where the torso meets the upper arm (humerus), along with muscles connected to the upper arm and those connected to the spine. They enable movement of the arm and stabilize the joint. They allow the arm to move closer or further away from the torso, and the shoulder has the widest range of motion in the human body, allowing movement of nearly 360 degrees. Habitual dislocation of the shoulder commonly occurs in teenagers or those in their twenties, mostly due to trauma, but occasionally can also occur without trauma. Cases without trauma occur when the joint is congenitally overly flexible. Habitual dislocation occurs when ligaments in the shoulder joint tear or stretch, and the treatment method differs significantly depending on whether the cause is traumatic or non-traumatic. Therefore, distinguishing the cause and deciding the treatment plan based on the cause are crucial considerations. In cases of habitual shoulder dislocation, it is essential to receive a specialized diagnosis to determine whether the cause is traumatic or not, and it is crucial to decide whether surgical treatment or the use of specific exercise therapies is the best course of action.
