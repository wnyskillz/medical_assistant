The uterus is located within the pelvic cavity, between the bladder and rectum. The lower 1/3 of the uterus is called the cervix. The uterus is shaped like a fruit, thick-walled, and hollow muscular organ. The rounded upper part of the uterus is called the fundus, the lower part the body, and the narrow part the cervix. The cervix has a tubular structure with a length of about 3-4cm, a diameter of about 2.5cm, and slightly swells at the midpoint. The cervix canal opens towards the vagina, and about half of the cervix forms the vaginal portion. The wall of the cervix is fibrous rather than muscular, composed of elastic tissue. The cervix plays an important role in pregnancy and childbirth, with its size and shape varying depending on situations like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth. The cervix acts as a barrier against viruses, bacteria, and germs, protecting the uterus from infections. In pregnancy, besides shielding the fetus from external harm, it also supports the growing heavier uterus. During childbirth, the cervical canal shortens and opens up to about 10cm for the baby to pass through the vagina, and post delivery, while the cervix returns to its pre-pregnancy state, it remains thicker and slightly looser. Early detection and treatment of abnormalities before they develop into cervical cancer are crucial. Women over 30 can receive free cervical cancer screenings every two years, and regular screenings based on age, risk factors, and health status are recommended. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to be a key factor in cervical cancer, and vaccination against it can be an effective preventive measure. Safe sexual practices such as delaying first sexual encounter and reducing the number of sexual partners may be helpful as HPV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact. Smoking increases the risk of developing cervical cancer, so quitting smoking is effective in preventing it. In cases where the cervix is too short to support the uterus during pregnancy, a cervical cerclage may be performed. It is possible for twin pregnancies or high-risk mothers from 14 to 16 weeks onwards, and for normal pregnancies from 18 to 22 weeks. Conditions such as previous surgeries, uterine malformations, vaginal infections, or cervical length can be diagnosed through ultrasound. The McDonald procedure involves ligating the cervix a couple of times and then removing the ligatures around 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy, initiating labor through uterine contractions.
