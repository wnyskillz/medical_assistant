The inside is lined with mucous membranes to regulate the humidity and temperature of the air when breathing, and antibacterial substances are secreted from the mucous glands. At the same time, olfactory cells are distributed to handle the sense of smell. Located at the center of the face, the nasal cavity refers to the space from inside the nose to the mouth. Just inside the nostrils, there are dome-shaped structures called nasal vestibules, and the deeper cavity leading up to the nasal cavity is called the nasal passage. The nasal cavity is divided into two parts by the nasal septum, with three layers of bones protruding inward like shelves. The inner surface of the nasal cavity has large, movable cilia to maintain humidity and secrete sebum to eliminate impurities from the inhaled air. Sensory cells responsible for the sense of smell are distributed on the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, allowing you to perceive odors. The nose takes in external air, filters out impurities, humidifies, and warms the air. As air flows from the nasal vestibule to the nasal septum, primary humidification, heating, and filtration occur, and impurities are further removed by the wide space and cilia of the nasal cavity. Air passing through the nasal vestibule and nasal cavity becomes suitable for respiration in the lungs. Nasal irrigation methods that can be done at home are necessary for those who have undergone nasal surgery, as nasal irrigation can effectively remove various secretions that occur after surgery. It also helps maintain moisture in the nose to sustain ciliary movement. Nasal irrigation washes away bacteria, dust, and allergens, making it beneficial for patients with inflammatory conditions such as rhinitis or sinusitis. To prepare for nasal irrigation, you will need a 50cc syringe and 0.9% saline solution available at pharmacies. Tilt your head forward over a sink, open your mouth wide, and spray 100cc of saline solution into one nostril using the syringe. Be careful not to touch the nasal mucosa with the syringe tip to avoid injury. Spray another 100cc of saline solution into the other nostril to flush out nasal secretions and foreign substances. After irrigation, wait 3-5 minutes before clearing remaining secretions by blowing your nose. Finally, tilt your head in all directions to ensure all trapped liquid in the sinuses is expelled. During irrigation, do not swallow the solution, and when blowing your nose afterward, do not pinch your nose closed, especially avoid forcefully blowing both nostrils simultaneously. Nasal irrigation is recommended at least twice a day in the morning and evening, for about 2 months or as instructed by a doctor. Nasal irrigation can be helpful on days when there is a lot of dust or during heavy pollen seasons. In winter, when the air is dry, nasal dryness can occur, causing itching, mild pain, and frequent nosebleeds. If nosebleeds become more frequent, it may be necessary to consult an otolaryngologist to check for inflammation. Excessive stimulation of the nasal mucosa can worsen nasal dryness, so proper treatment is essential from the beginning. Applying ointment to the nasal mucosa can help alleviate dryness, and it is advised to avoid habits that irritate the nasal cavity.
