The wall of the eyeball is composed of fibrous, vascular, and neural layers, and the thin neural layer that surrounds the innermost part is called the retina. The retina is formed in two layers at the back of the eyeball, the outer part is called the pigment layer of the retina, and the inner part is called the neural layer of the retina. The retina consists of nerve cells and nerve glial cells, and the fovea, which has a high concentration of cone cells that detect colors and is slightly depressed, is the center where the visual acuity is the highest and most responsive. The yellowish part around the fovea is called the macula and is the central part of vision. Anatomically, the retina is classified as a terminal sensory organ, but embryologically, it can be considered as part of the central nervous system. When light enters the eye through the cornea and lens, it is focused on the retina, which converts it into electrical signals to be transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. In particular, the photoreceptor cells containing the opsins protein molecule absorb photons and transmit signals to the retinal cells, which then establish visual perception through communication between neurons. The central part where vision occurs is the macula, and the retina outside the macula is responsible for seeing in dark conditions and peripheral vision. The external image entering through the lens is inverted on the retina, and since the two eyes look at objects from different angles, the images on each eye's retina are mismatched, allowing for depth perception of objects. Rod cells in the retina respond sensitively to low levels of light, allowing identification of objects in dark conditions, while cone cells, which are less sensitive to light, distinguish colors and send color information to the brain through the optic nerve. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from its proper position due to various reasons, with the most common form being rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, in which a hole forms in the retina allowing fluid to enter and detach the retina. 80% of the volume of the eyeball is filled with vitreous humor, and if the vitreous liquefies and detaches, the retina may tear along with it. Symptoms such as floaters in the vision and flashing lights when moving the eyes from side to side may indicate conditions like floaters and flashes, which can be easily treated with lasers but may require surgical treatment in widespread cases, so early detection is crucial. Diabetic retinopathy, caused by diabetes, occurs when insulin deficiency leads to long-term metabolic abnormalities, weakening and damaging the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing hemorrhage. If blood flow is blocked due to hemorrhage, new blood vessels may be generated, resulting in the loss of function of the hemorrhaged area of the retina, leading to retinal detachment. Diabetic retinopathy occurs more frequently and worsens with longer duration of diabetes.
