The uvula is a piece of tissue that hangs down at the back of the throat at the tip of the soft palate, which is easily visible when you open your mouth. It is located in the area where the soft palate connects to the throat and the uvula hangs down from the roof of the mouth. The uvula, also known as the palatine uvula, has a softer tissue structure at its upper part known as the submucous cleft. It is a part where the pathway for food and air converge, and the uvula plays a role in helping food pass through the esophagus without entering the airway for breathing. When swallowing food, the uvula contracts to separate the nasal passage from the throat, aiding in precise pronunciation and preventing food from regurgitating into the nose. Occasionally, when the uvula is enlarged due to a tumor or congenital condition, a condition called snoring may occur when the elongated uvula obstructs the airway. Snoring is the sound produced when respiratory structures vibrate when the muscles relax and the airway narrows during sleep, causing efforts to breathe. In some cases, although not visible externally in children, a cleft palate may appear when speaking, laughing, or crying, where the uvula appears divided into two. A cleft palate is characterized by the palate being divided, revealing two uvulas, and it can influence jaw development, affecting the facial shape and requiring not only orthodontic but also dental correction. When the upper part of the airway narrows during sleep, causing reduced or complete cessation of breathing, it is referred to as sleep apnea. The reduced elasticity of the surrounding tissues of the airway, such as the uvula and submucous cleft, causes the airway structures to collapse when inhaling, obstructing breathing.
