It exists between the bones throughout our body. The structure surrounding the joint can be divided into muscles, tendons, ligaments, synovial membrane, joint capsule, and cartilage. It supports the joint and provides the strength to move. It connects bones and muscles. It secretes synovial fluid to reduce friction between bones. It surrounds the synovial membrane and reduces friction. It exists at the end of the bones and supports weight-bearing and reduces friction. The types of joints can be divided according to the tissues between the two opposing bones. Fibrous joints connect two bones with fibrous connective tissue and are mostly immobile fixed joints. Cartilaginous joints have the bones connected by cartilage and allow limited movement when twisted or compressed. The most common form of joint has joint cartilage covering the space between two bones and a synovial joint capsule filled with synovial fluid. Joints connect the bones and enable various movements such as straight, angular, and rotational movements, allowing the movements of our body. Among the joints, synovial joints, in particular, allow relatively free range of movement with low friction. The most common joint disorder is arthritis, with osteoarthritis being the most common form. Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative arthritis, is a condition related to joint injury or aging. Osteoarthritis cannot be cured. The goal of treatment is to relieve pain, maintain joint mobility, and prevent progression of joint damage. There are various methods such as drug therapy, exercise, heat therapy, cold therapy to relieve pain and maintain joint movement, and in severe cases, surgical treatment may be considered.
