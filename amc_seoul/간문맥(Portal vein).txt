The blood from the stomach and intestines goes to the liver through the blood vessels, carrying nutrients absorbed in the digestive tract to the liver and supplying nutrients to liver cells along with the hepatic artery. The portal vein is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen and starts behind the head of the pancreas, extending to the liver. It is about 8 cm long in adults and consists of the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein. It divides into right and left branches near the liver, and further branches into smaller veins and hepatic portal veins that connect to the liver. The portal vein function transports blood from the intestines to the liver through mesenteric vessels. 75% of incoming blood goes through the portal vein, and the remaining 25% goes through the hepatic artery. The intestine receives blood supply through the superior mesenteric artery, and the portal vein transports nutrient-rich blood from the small and large intestines to the liver, where the liver stores and processes these nutrients. If blood flow in the veins slows down, leading to portal vein backflow, it can result in portal hypertension, mainly associated with liver cirrhosis. The impact of portal hypertension is extensive and severe, causing complications such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and other serious conditions. When hepatic encephalopathy occurs, the circulation of blood in the liver is impaired, resulting in increased ammonia levels in the bloodstream because the liver cannot process it effectively. Ammonia in the blood can be toxic to the central nervous system, leading to hepatic coma in severe cases. Hepatic coma is a common symptom in patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis. In the early stages, it may cause memory impairment, slow responses, and decreased concentration, progressing to confusion, coma, and even death depending on the severity at the end stage.
