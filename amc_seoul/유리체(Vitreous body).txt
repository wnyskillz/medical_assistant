Once you log in, you can enjoy even more benefits. The vitreous body, also known as the vitreous humor, is a transparent, avascular gel-like tissue that occupies most of the eyeball. Composed of 99% water, the vitreous body helps maintain the shape of the eye and its transparency, allowing light to pass through to the retina. Positioned within the eye socket, it takes up most of the space behind the lens. The vitreous body is transparent, elastic, and composed of a highly viscous liquid, accounting for two-thirds of the eye's volume and weight. It is made up of 99% water and the remaining 1% consists of collagen and hyaluronic acid to maintain elasticity. Located at the back of the eye, the vitreous body is in close proximity to the retina, meaning that damage to the vitreous body can lead to retinal disorders. It maintains the round shape and transparency of the eye, allowing images to focus on the retina and aiding in clear vision. It also protects the eye from external impacts and secures the retina firmly to the back of the eye wall. As we age or due to eye diseases, parts of the vitreous body may liquefy or shrink, leading to floaters in the eye known as "myodesopsia." Additionally, if there is bleeding or inflammation inside the eye, the vitreous body can become cloudy, causing visual impairment. In some cases, the vitreous body may need to be removed, but functioning of the eye is not typically affected even without it.
