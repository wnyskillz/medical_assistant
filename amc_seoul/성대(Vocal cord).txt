They are located on both sides inside the larynx. The vocal cords are less than 2cm in size and consist of epithelial cell layer, connective tissue layer, and muscle layer, having a mucous membrane in a V-shape inside the larynx. The space between the vocal cords is called the glottis, and the space from the glottis through the larynx, oral cavity to the nasal cavity and lips is called the pharynx. In the throat, there are both the esophagus for food passage and the airway for air passage. At the upper part of the airway is the larynx, which protects the lower airway. Inside this larynx are the vocal cords, which open and close the glottis by moving, allowing for breathing and vocalization. To protect the vocal cords, it is good to use a humidifier to maintain the appropriate humidity of the inhaled air and drink enough water to supply sufficient moisture to the vocal cords. It is recommended to avoid milk and dairy products as they can produce phlegm, and barley tea or water is preferable. By wrapping the area around the mouth with a damp towel and breathing deeply through the mouth into warm water, you can provide moisture to the vocal cords. Vocal cord nodules can occur frequently in children because they tend to talk excessively or shout loudly without protecting their vocal cords. Early treatment is important for vocal cord nodules in children. If the vocal cord muscles are used incorrectly, memory cells can cause a chronic hoarse voice and even voice distortion. Prompt intervention is necessary to avoid this. In the case of children, appropriate voice training alone can be a sufficient treatment.
