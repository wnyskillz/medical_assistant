Hematopoietic stem cells, which are mainly found in the bone marrow and can also be present in peripheral blood and cord blood of newborns, play a role in producing red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. If hematopoietic stem cells develop abnormalities and cause diseases, the disease can be treated by transplanting these cells. Hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by the presence of the CD34 marker, produce red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and they have the ability to self-replicate for continuous hematopoiesis. Depending on where they are collected from, hematopoietic stem cells can be categorized into bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and cord blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Recently, there has been an increased interest in cord blood hematopoietic stem cells, which are collected from the umbilical cord or placenta after delivery. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can also be classified into autologous stem cell transplantation, where stem cells are collected from one's own bone marrow or peripheral blood for storage and later transplantation when needed, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, where stem cells are donated to another person, potentially leading to immune rejection reactions.
