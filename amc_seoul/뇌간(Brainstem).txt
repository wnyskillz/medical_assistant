If you log in, you can use a variety of benefits. It is located in the middle of the brain, excluding the left and right cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. It is a combination of the diencephalon, midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata, with the latter connecting to the spinal cord below. Serving as a stem connecting the brain and spinal cord, it is closely related to various parts of the brain such as the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Additionally, 10 pairs of cranial nerves, excluding the olfactory nerve (1st cranial nerve) and optic nerve (2nd cranial nerve), originate from the brainstem. Located at the base of the brain, it is situated inside the cerebral hemispheres. The brainstem is located between the diencephalon and the spinal cord, anterior to the cerebellum. The diameter of the brainstem is about 8cm and it consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. The brainstem provides pathways for ascending and descending nerve fibers, and it gives rise to 12 pairs of cranial nerves, excluding the olfactory and optic nerves, and ten pairs of peripheral nerves. It contains a densely packed region of gray matter where nerve cells are concentrated, which contains melanin pigment and the darker appearing substantia nigra. The Midbrain: Situated between the diencephalon and the pons, medulla, and cerebellum, it contains many nuclei. The midbrain controls unconscious reflex movements, regulates the autonomic nervous system, and controls body temperature and blood sugar. Pons (Bridge): A bulging area in front of the brainstem which relays information between the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres and plays a role in respiratory control alongside the medulla. Medulla: Also known as the medulla oblongata, it is the space between the pons and the cerebellum known as the fourth ventricle, with many nerve cells connected to playing a role as a relay station for the autonomic nervous system. Reticular Formation: The mesh-like structure where nerve cells are scattered throughout the center of the diencephalon, midbrain, pons, and medulla. The excitability of this formation regulates the state of consciousness. The brainstem facilitates communication between the brain and spinal cord through nerve bundles, relaying signals between the cerebellum and cerebrum, as well as between the cerebellum and spinal cord. The gray matter region of the brainstem regulates essential functions for sustaining life such as breathing and blood pressure, and modulates the intensity of physical pain sensation. The brainstem controls movement, serves as the reflex center, and plays a crucial role as the autonomous nervous system. The brain is broadly divided into three parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem. When the brain's functions are impaired due to illness or injury, and gradually lead to loss of function, consciousness is lost, and a state of coma occurs. When spontaneous movements become impossible, and even spontaneous breathing cannot be carried out, leading to death (brain death), one of the criteria for determining brain death includes the complete loss of brainstem reflexes. Since the medulla in the brainstem plays a role as a central hub for spontaneous breathing and vital functions, any damage to this part can have a significant impact on human life. If all responses originating from the brainstem cease and spontaneous breathing does not resume, a diagnosis of brain death can be made. The difference between brain death and a vegetative state also depends on the extent of damage to this brainstem. Brain death is a state where the brainstem is so damaged that it cannot recover, while a vegetative state refers to a condition where the brainstem is functioning properly and allows for spontaneous breathing without the need for a ventilator.
