These occur in organs with internal space such as the stomach, colon, large intestine, gallbladder, and bladder. It is a form where the wall of the organ protrudes outward in a rounded bulge shape. There are pseudodiverticula that are limited to the mucous membrane and submucosal tissue of the organ wall and true diverticula that protrude from the entire wall of the organ forming a pocket including the muscle layer. Diverticula are especially common in the colon and occur frequently in countries where high-protein, high-fat, low-fiber diets are common.
