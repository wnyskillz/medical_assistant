The upper part of the coccyx bone is connected to the sacrum and the lower part is connected to the tailbone, forming a large triangular shape that narrows from top to bottom. During the growth process, five vertebrae merge and solidify into one bone in adulthood, making it the largest bone in the spine. The coccyx bone has 4 transverse lines on each side and a hole called the sacral foramen at each end, through which the coccygeal nerve from the spinal cord passes. There are differences between men and women in the coccyx bone, but it is not always distinctly visible. Generally, men's coccyx bones are long and narrow with deep curves, while women's are short and wide with smaller curves. It supports the weight of the upper spine and disperses it to the pelvis to support the weight. Anesthetic may be administered through the coccyx opening for partial anesthesia. Lower back pain is experienced by everyone at least once in a lifetime. Individuals who sit for long periods at work may experience pain from the lower back, pelvis, and legs due to the muscles supporting the spine and maintaining posture becoming tense from prolonged sitting. If you are suffering from lower back pain, try the following exercises: 1. Creating lumbar curvature by placing a small elastic ball under the lower back (just above the coccyx bone) while sitting at a desk helps maintain spinal curvature and prevent pain. 2. Stretching the gluteal muscles by crossing one leg over the opposite knee and leaning forward while pressing the knee with hands. Maintain stretching position where slight tension is felt in the outer areas of the glutes and thighs. 3. Stretching the side of the body by holding onto the opposite armrest with one hand while raising the opposite arm above the head and leaning the torso about 20-30 degrees towards the armrest. Maintain the stretch with tension in the lower side of the waist under the hand reached upwards. *Caution: Keep the pelvis stable to avoid lifting the buttocks. 4. Rotating the torso backwards while sitting on a chair with the back straight, and turning the upper body in one direction. Maintain the stretch at a slightly tense point after applying pressure to the waist. *Caution: Do not over-rotate and be mindful not to hold your breath. *It is recommended to perform exercises 2-4 for 15-20 seconds, 3-5 times.
