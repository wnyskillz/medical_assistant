The cortex consists of nerve cells, gathering on the outer layer of the brain. It wraps around the surface of the brain and is darker in color compared to the inner part of the brain, containing nerve cell bodies and capillaries. The brain is located within the confined space of the skull, forming a complex wrinkled surface with gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves). The cerebral cortex performs various functions depending on the area, such as sensory, motor, and language functions. Motor area: Located in the central precentral gyrus, responsible for voluntary movements. Damage can lead to motor paralysis. Premotor area: Located in front of the motor area, involved in planning motor programs. Damage can result in apraxia, inability to perform learned movements. Sensory area: Located in the central postcentral gyrus, responsible for touch, pain, and pressure sensations. Damage can cause sensory disorders. Somatosensory association area: Located behind the sensory area, integrates incoming sensory information for understanding. Damage can result in astereognosis, inability to recognize objects by touch. Motor speech area: Located in the lower part of the frontal lobe of the left cerebral hemisphere, known as Broca's area. Damage can lead to expressive aphasia, inability to speak fluently. Sensory speech area: Located in the left temporal lobe, known as Wernicke's area. Damage can cause receptive aphasia, inability to understand spoken language. Visual area: Located in the inner part of the occipital lobe, where visual information is processed. Damage can lead to inability to see the opposite side. Auditory area: Located in the transverse temporal gyri of the temporal lobe, where auditory information is processed. Damage to one side does not lead to complete hearing loss due to information being transmitted from both ears. Association area: Refers to all areas excluding motor and sensory areas. It performs complex mental functions by integrating various information, allowing abilities such as memory, imagination, learning, and intentional actions. Degenerative brain diseases that affect the cerebral cortex include Alzheimer's Disease and Pick's Disease, with dementia being the main symptom. Alzheimer's Disease causes atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, shrinking the brain and reducing its weight. Pick's Disease results in severe atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes, with the loss of nerve cells occurring outside the cerebral cortex. Language disorders that arise from diseases affecting brain regions responsible for language function are referred to as aphasias. However, language disorders caused by speech or hearing organ abnormalities are not considered aphasias.
