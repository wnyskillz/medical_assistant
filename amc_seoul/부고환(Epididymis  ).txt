As a part of the male reproductive system, it is an organ located on the outer backside of the testicle, connected to the vas deferens and is responsible for maturing sperm. Located within each scrotum, attached to the outside of the testicle on one side and connected to the vas deferens on the other side. A structure composed of thin tubes attached to the back side of the testicle, one end connected to the testicle and the other end connected to the vas deferens. The epididymis is made up of a very thin, coiled tube that, when unfolded, reaches a length of about 6m in total. Even if one part of the epididymis is cut off, it can cause problems with sperm not being able to be ejaculated through the vas deferens. The epididymis is divided into head, body, and tail, each responsible for regulating the concentration of semen differently depending on the region. Sperm produced in the testicle mature temporarily in the epididymis, gaining motility as they pass through here, ultimately acquiring the ability to fertilize eggs. When reaching orgasm, the muscles contract to expel the sperm from the epididymis. Epididymitis occurs when bacteria-infected urine flows back through the vas deferens to the epididymis. If the back of the testicle enlarges, severe pain occurs, or there is a persistent discomfort in the scrotum, epididymitis should be suspected, and it is recommended to seek medical attention. In cases of azoospermia, where sperm is not found in a husband's semen analysis, pregnancy was previously impossible. However, in recent years, through techniques like surgical sperm retrieval from the testicle or epididymis for in vitro fertilization, pregnancy has become possible even in cases of azoospermia.
