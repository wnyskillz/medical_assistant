The penis passes urine, enables sexual intercourse, and serves as a passage for ejaculate and urine. It is located where the lower abdomen meets the pelvis. The penis has no bones internally and is made up of erectile tissue called corpora cavernosa. When blood fills the erectile tissue of the penis during an erection, it enlarges and hardens, allowing for sexual intercourse. Inside the erectile tissue of the penis is the urethra, which ends with the glans. The skin of the penis is very thin with minimal subcutaneous fat, and wrinkles are formed around the glans. The penis is connected to the testes and epididymis by the scrotum, and internally, it is connected to the vas deferens, which in turn connects to the urethra. It serves as a passage for ejaculation and urination. Hypospadias is a disorder that can occur in males, where the opening of the urethra is located on the underside of the penis rather than at the tip. This can be due to inadequate development of the tissue surrounding the urethra when various organs of the fetus are forming during pregnancy and is becoming more common due to environmental hormonal influences. While hypospadias might not cause issues in infants, as the child grows, urination problems can arise and might require sitting down to urinate. It can also lead to difficulties in sexual activity and ejaculating into the vagina, potentially causing infertility. Hypospadias is typically treatable with surgery, often performed before the age of one.
