If you log in, you can enjoy even more benefits. It corresponds to the fourth of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves, and plays a role in regulating eye movement. The nerve fibers extend from the midbrain to the eyes and are located between the superior oblique nerve above and the inferior oculomotor nerve below. It is the thinnest and only nerve that emerges from the back of the brainstem, crossing over from the opposite side at the junction of the cerebral peduncle and the midbrain aqueduct, extending outward from the brainstem. Each trochlear nerve emerges from the midbrain forward, passing between the brainstem and the cerebral artery. It passes below the superior oblique nerve and above the oculomotor nerve, crossing the tentorial sinus. The trochlear nerve is a pure motor nerve that controls the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, rotating the eye inward and moving it downward and outward. Damage to the trochlear nerve can cause diplopia or strabismus when the eye moves outward. When the trochlear nerve is paralyzed, looking downward may not cause the paralyzed eye to descend sufficiently, resulting in vertical diplopia. Generally, diplopia (seeing double) occurs horizontally, but vertical diplopia is much more uncomfortable for the patient. In particular, professions that involve going downstairs or moving the eyes up and down frequently will experience more discomfort. The trochlear nerve often recovers naturally after several months, but if the symptoms worsen or persist, surgical treatment may be considered. Surgery may involve weakening or adjusting the muscles controlled by the trochlear nerve to help with eye movement. Wearing prismatic glasses instead of surgery is a method to correct diplopia, but since the success rate is low, if discomfort persists, it is advisable to opt for surgical treatment.
