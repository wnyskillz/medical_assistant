Testosterone is a male hormone that promotes the development of male reproductive organs and the expression and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics. In males, testosterone is produced in the testes' Leydig cells, while in females, it is secreted by the ovaries and adrenal glands. Testosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the Leydig cells of the testes, secreted into the bloodstream, and acts in various parts of the body. Testosterone is often referred to as the male hormone due to its role in expressing male characteristics. During puberty, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates sperm production, while luteinizing hormone (LH) or interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH) stimulates testosterone production. Testosterone is produced throughout life, and when its secretion increases, male secondary sexual characteristics such as deepening of the voice, increased body hair, muscle mass, and skeletal mass occur. It acts on the sexual center of the brain to regulate sexual thoughts and behavior and is involved in the entire process of sexual function of the genitals, including the penis, testes, prostate, and scrotum. It influences sexual desire and arousal in both men and women. When male hormones decrease, muscle mass and strength decrease, leading to a flabby body with increased abdominal obesity and thinning of the arms and legs. Reduced energy, depression, and decreased sexual function may occur. This can result in metabolic syndromes such as obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. In cases of insufficient male hormones, supplementation may be necessary, but this should only be done after consultation with a doctor. Adequate and safe testosterone replacement therapy can have excellent benefits for male aging. Administering testosterone shots when male hormone levels are normal can lead to many side effects, such as testicular atrophy, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and prostate cancer. External testosterone injections can weaken the body's natural hormone production capacity, leading to decreased sperm and semen volume, as well as an enlarged prostate. Before starting testosterone therapy, a digital rectal examination should be conducted to examine the prostate. Preceding tests such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, and lipid profiles should also be performed.
