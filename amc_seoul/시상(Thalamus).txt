It is located inside the brain and at the anterior part of the midbrain. It is located at the top of the brainstem, with the third ventricle in between and on each side. It is connected to the cerebral cortex and forms the walls of the ventricles. The thalamus is shaped like a round egg with a length of about 2.5cm and a height of 2cm. Together with the thalamic subparts, it makes up the thalamus and consists of many groups of nerve nuclei. The thalamus is composed of a cortex and medulla, forming a single oval shape on each side of the cerebral hemisphere. The thalamus is divided into four parts: the thalamic top, thalamic anterior, thalamic posterior, and thalamic back, with thalamic top and thalamic anterior being distinct parts of the nervous system unlike the thalamus. Multiple nuclei located in the thalamus receive sensory information from receptors and send it to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus is the central integration center for the major sensory pathways projecting to the cerebral cortex except for olfaction; visual, auditory, and somatosensory pathways pass through the thalamus to reach the cerebral cortex, where all sensory nerve pathways for motor signal regulation are gathered at the thalamus before being transmitted to the corresponding sensory cortex. Specifically, forming circuits between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex allows them to interact and control sleep and wakefulness, so damage to this area can lead to permanent coma. Nuclei in the posterior part of the thalamus play a role in relaying somatosensory information, while the lateral geniculate nucleus and the medial geniculate nucleus in the posterior thalamus relay visual and auditory information. The central nuclei play a crucial role in consciousness and are also involved in motor functions and emotional regulation.
