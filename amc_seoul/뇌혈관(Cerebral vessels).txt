The brain receives blood through two major arteries: the internal carotid artery carrying blood from the front of the two brain hemispheres, and the vertebral artery carrying blood from the back into the posterior fossa. Generally, about 80% of the total cerebral blood flow comes from the internal carotid artery, while 20% comes from the vertebral artery. Blockages or bleeding in the arteries responsible for supplying blood to the brain can lead to neurological dysfunctions. The brain is surrounded by the skull internally, and two pairs of arteries supply blood to the brain. One is the Vertebral artery and the other is the Internal carotid artery. The vertebral artery, which arises from the subclavian artery, travels up the neck along the spine and joins the basilar artery under the pons of the brainstem. The basilar artery divides near the midbrain and eventually connects to the posterior cerebral artery. The internal carotid artery, branching from the common carotid artery, travels through the neck, passes through the temporal bone, and enters the skull. Within the skull, the internal carotid artery branches into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, providing blood supply to the majority of the cerebrum. These arteries form a circle of arteries at the base of the brain to ensure continuous circulation of blood. Adequate continuous blood supply to the brain is crucial because even a few minutes of blood deprivation can lead to brain cell damage. The brain weighs about 2% of body weight but requires 15-20% of the blood pumped by the heart. Therefore, any disruption in blood circulation in the brain, such as a brief period of reduced oxygen supply, can be critical to the human body. To prevent stroke, it is important to identify risk factors, actively treat factors that can lead to the development of disease, such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, family history of stroke, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, poor diet, alcohol consumption, and risk factors of cerebral hemorrhage. To prevent stroke in daily life, avoid staying in cold environments for prolonged periods or sudden exposure to cold. When the external environment is cold, blood vessels constrict, leading to increased blood pressure and a higher risk of vessel rupture. Maintain regular exercise to keep the body moving and consume energy. Avoid excessive salt intake, keeping it within 10g per day is recommended. Avoid foods high in cholesterol and consume fresh vegetables and fruits to prevent atherosclerosis. The human tissues typically use glucose, fatty acids, and ketones as energy sources. However, the brain primarily relies on glucose for energy unless in emergencies. Therefore, if there is insufficient glucose in the body due to filtering during meals, dizziness may occur.
