The carotid artery, also known as the common carotid artery, is the main blood vessel that carries blood to the brain through the neck from the aorta in the chest. It is a pair of blood vessels that extend forward, supplying blood to most of the brain except for the back part. It is a blood vessel that ascends from the sides of the neck towards the head. The pair of blood vessels that ascend from the front of the neck are called the common carotid arteries, which split into the internal carotid artery supplying blood to the brain and the external carotid artery supplying blood to the scalp and face. If small arteries become blocked or rupture, it can lead to the cessation of brain function supplied by that blood vessel, resulting in symptoms such as hemiplegia, sensory impairment, visual disturbances, language disorders, and mental disorders. The human brain receives oxygen and nutrients from three main blood vessels: the anterior cerebral artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior cerebral artery. Blood vessels connected to the brain through the carotid artery from the heart supply blood to the brain, and the carotid artery extends outward into the internal carotid artery to supply blood. Approximately 80% of the total brain blood supply is through the internal carotid artery, while the remaining 20% is supplied by the vertebral artery. Many people consider it a cure when severe narrowing of the coronary arteries or carotid arteries is corrected through stent placement or surgical methods to eliminate the narrowed areas. However, atherosclerosis is a disease that affects systemic arteries with varying degrees, and myocardial infarction does not always occur in severely narrowed blood vessel segments; rather, it can occur when atherosclerotic plaques rupture suddenly on the vessel wall with a high cholesterol buildup, leading to the formation of blood clots.
