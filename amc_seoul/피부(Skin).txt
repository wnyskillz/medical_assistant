The epithelial tissue that covers our body's muscles and organs is composed of epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, protecting the body from the external environment, regulating body temperature, and allowing us to feel sensations. It is distributed throughout our body. The skin accounts for approximately 7% of adult body weight, with an average thickness of about 1.5mm. The soles of the feet and palms of the hands are the thickest parts of the skin, while the eyelids, eardrums, and external genitals are the thinnest parts. The skin is composed of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat layer. The epidermis is located at the surface of the skin, producing keratin and protecting the skin. The dermis is the tissue beneath the epidermis, containing hair follicles, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and muscles. Elastin fibers and collagen fibers in the dermis maintain the skin's tone and elasticity. The subcutaneous tissue is the part beneath the dermis that stores fat tissue and provides insulation, shock absorption, and regulates body temperature. The skin contains sensory receptors that respond to touch, pressure, heat, and cold. The areas with dense sensory receptors, such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and lips, are particularly sensitive to touch. The outer layer of the skin consists of a tough layer of keratin, while the skin underneath is made up of thick fatty tissue that protects against impact and friction. Sebaceous glands exist to protect the body and prevent skin dryness. The skin barrier and acidity on the skin surface help prevent microbial penetration. It performs excretory functions through sebum and sweat. It regulates body temperature through blood vessel constriction and sweat secretion. Sensory receptors in the skin allow us to feel touch, pressure, heat, cold, and pain. When exposed to sunlight, the skin converts provitamin D to vitamin D. Strong UV rays can cause skin aging. UV rays are classified as UVA, UVB, and UVC based on their wavelength lengths, with UVA and UVB being the main concerns. UVA rays have the longest wavelength among UV rays and penetrate the dermis, leading to skin darkening. UVB rays have shorter wavelengths than UVA and can cause skin rashes or inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to use sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays with designated SPF and PA ratings when going out.
