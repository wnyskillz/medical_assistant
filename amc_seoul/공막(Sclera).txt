It contains muscles responsible for eye movement, maintains the shape of the eye, and protects the eye from external impacts. The white part we see in our eyes is the sclera shining through the transparent conjunctiva. It is located on the rest of the eye's surface except for the cornea and consists of the outer layer of the eye excluding the cornea, appearing opaque white. It is covered by a transparent conjunctiva in the front of the eye and occupies the outermost layer of the eye towards the back. The muscles attached to the sclera allow for free movement of the eye in various directions. It is connected to the membrane surrounding the optic nerve at the back. The sclera has fewer blood vessels and a less active metabolism compared to other tissues, making diseases less common. The dense fibrous tissue of the sclera helps maintain the round shape of the eye. The muscles attached to the sclera have a correlation to left and right movements, so when moving the right eye, the left eye moves in unison. This coordinated movement is called conjugate movement. If there are problems with the motor function, strabismus occurs. Convergence movement refers to both eyes moving inward when focusing on a very close object.
