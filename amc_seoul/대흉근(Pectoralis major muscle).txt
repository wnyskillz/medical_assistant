The pectoralis major is a large fan-shaped muscle that covers the front and upper part of the chest, moving the arm at the shoulder joint of the upper arm and moving the shoulder blade at the shoulder joint. It covers the entire chest from below the collarbone and connects to the upper arm bone. It is a large fan-shaped muscle that starts at the outer side of the breastbone and inner side of the collarbone, horizontally connecting to the upper arm bone. It extensively covers the upper part of both chests, controlled by the spinal nerves including the neck and chest nerves. It can be touched directly on the skin, with the part that touches along the edge of the armpit when the upper arm bone is spread being the pectoralis major. It functions to rotate and bend the shoulder and upper arm bones inward, and to move the trunk back and forth. When the outer side of the collarbone protrudes forward, the pectoralis major extends the upper arm bone, and when the head of the collarbone bends inward, the pectoralis major pulls the upper arm bone. Tissue transfer refers to moving skin or tissue from one part of the body to another, and tissue transfer using the pectoralis major is most commonly used for reconstruction of the head section and also for facial skin and esophageal reconstruction.
