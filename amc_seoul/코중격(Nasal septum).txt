The nasal septum divides the nasal cavity into left and right sides, with a thickness of about 1-2mm, rigid and flat in shape supporting the bridge of the nose and the tip of the nose while covered with mucous membrane. It is located in the nasal cavity between the nostrils. The human nose is divided into two chambers due to a vertical wall called the nasal septum located inside. The front part of the nasal septum is made of cartilage, some of which is covered with connective tissue in mucous membrane form. The upper part of the nasal septum transitions into bone. The central portion of the nasal septum cartilage has a thickness of 3-4mm and becomes thicker as it descends. The back of the cartilage is connected to the ethmoid and sphenoid bones, with a perpendicular plate between them. Generally, the nasal septum is mostly convoluted, but when it is excessively curved causing symptoms such as nasal congestion or functional impairment, it is called nasal septal deviation. It supports the nasal skeleton from the center, providing support for the tip of the nose and the bridge of the nose. It acts as an air passage, helping the nose function properly. As part of the nasal cavity, when external air flows in, it heats and humidifies the air, secreting antimicrobial substances from the mucous glands to remove impurities and filter them. If the nasal septum is deviated to one side instead of centrally located in the nose, the airway in the affected direction narrows, leading to nasal congestion. The side of the nose opposite to the deviated nasal septum may seem relatively wider, but in fact, it may lead to mucosal swelling, making breathing less efficient. This can result in a condition called postnasal drip where the nasal passage flows into the throat, and these symptoms worsen especially when lying down.
