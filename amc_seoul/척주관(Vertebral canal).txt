Inside the spinal canal, there are the spinal cord, meninges, blood vessels, and some peripheral nerves. It is located behind the vertebrae, extending along the back. Each vertebra has a vertebral body and a vertebral arch, forming intervertebral foramina between them. These foramina form the vertebral canal, a nerve pathway that extends from the brain through the cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), lumbar (lower back), and sacral (pelvic) vertebrae to the coccyx (tailbone). Through this spinal canal, the spinal cord, yellow ligament, meninges, blood vessels, and some peripheral nerves pass. The spinal canal protects the spinal cord inside and is further protected by the yellow ligament in front and the posterior longitudinal ligament in the back. As people age, the discs that act as cushions lose elasticity, causing narrowing of the intervertebral foramina due to degenerative changes in the spine. This can lead to compression of spinal nerves, resulting in symptoms such as leg numbness and having to sit down due to walking causing discomfort. In most cases, appropriate posture education can help, but if there are severe neurological symptoms and difficulty with walking and daily activities, surgical treatment may be necessary.
