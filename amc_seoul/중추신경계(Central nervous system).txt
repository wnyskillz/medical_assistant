The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord, performing important functions such as receiving and regulating the sensations felt in our body, controlling movement, and regulating vital functions. The brain, enclosed within the skull, is composed of the cerebrum, diencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum, and pons, with the medulla oblongata connecting to the spinal cord. The brain is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid that protects it from external impacts. The cerebrum's outer layer is made of gray matter with many nerve cell bodies, while the inner part is composed of white matter containing nerve fibers. The spinal cord is situated inside the spinal canal and is protected by vertebral bones and cerebrospinal fluid, like the brain. It is around 45cm long, weighs about 25g, and can be divided into different regions based on where it exits - cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal segments. The brain can be divided into the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem, each with distinct functions. The cerebrum occupies most of the brain, divided into two hemispheres responsible for various functions like sensory perception, movement, language, and cognition. The cerebellum, situated beneath the cerebrum, coordinates precise movements, maintains posture, and balance. The brainstem, located between the midbrain and spinal cord, helps in transmitting information and controlling facial and eye movements. The medulla oblongata, between the spinal cord and cerebellum, regulates functions like breathing and circulation. It acts as a bridge connecting the body's nervous system to the brain, transmitting sensory information and motor commands. Dizziness can stem from issues in the peripheral or central nervous system. Sudden dizziness is often caused by reduced blood flow to the brain due to conditions like anemia, orthostatic hypotension, or decreased heart function. Dizziness originating from central nervous system issues can be more dangerous, often related to cerebral vascular diseases. Timely intervention is crucial to prevent further progression leading to language or motor impairments, as these conditions can result from brain dysfunction due to neglected dizziness.
