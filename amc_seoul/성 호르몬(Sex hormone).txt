Sex hormones can be classified into male hormones and female hormones. Testosterone is a male hormone, while estradiol and progesterone are female hormones. Testosterone, a male hormone, is produced in the testes, estradiol, a female hormone, is produced in the follicles of the ovaries, and progesterone is produced in the corpus luteum. The hormones produced are released directly into the bloodstream and have specific physiological effects on reproductive function. Testosterone helps with secondary sexual characteristics in males, promotes sperm production, develops male reproductive organs such as the prostate and scrotum, and helps build muscle. Estradiol promotes the development of the uterus, stimulates milk secretion, and contributes to secondary sexual characteristics in females. Progesterone promotes the growth of the uterine lining, prepares it for easy implantation of the egg, and helps maintain pregnancy. The secretion of sex hormones is controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. When the hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary, it secretes follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which promote the production of testosterone in males and stimulate the secretion of estradiol and progesterone in females. When the function of the testes or ovaries decreases, leading to a decrease in sex hormone secretion and dysfunction of germ cells, it is called hypogonadism. If secondary sexual characteristics do not appear after the age of 13-15 or if puberty growth begins and growth is not completed within 4 and a half years, it may be suspected. Boys may develop undescended testes and gynecomastia, while girls may experience amenorrhea or delayed onset of secondary sexual characteristics. Hormone replacement is administered to maintain hormone levels close to physiological concentrations produced in our bodies.
