It is located on the outer side of both lower arms, positioned on the outer side of the forearm. The radius bone is longer and larger than the ulna bone, forming a large triangular prism shape at the lower end. The part connected to the wrist, based on the torso, is called the distal end, and the part connected to the upper arm is called the proximal end. It forms the wrist joint connected to the hand bone and the elbow joint connected to the humerus bone. The function of the forearm is to connect the upper arm and the lower arm. It allows bending, stretching, and rotating movements in one direction around the elbow joint and two directions around the wrist joint. One of the most common wrist fractures that occur during the winter season is the wrist fracture, which mainly affects middle-aged women due to osteoporosis. When slipping and falling, if the hand is reached out to support the fall, it can lead to a fracture on the distal end of the radius bone, the part of the wrist that supports the hand during a fall. This type of fracture commonly occurs in postmenopausal women whose bones are weakened and typically experiences a significant amount of force, around 2 to 10 times the body weight on the wrist. Wrist fractures also occur in young people who engage in activities such as inline skating, snowboarding, and skiing, with more severe fractures due to the increased force on the wrist and occasional joint involvement. Fractures can cause pain, swelling, and discomfort, and if the fractured bone is significantly displaced, it may compress nerves, leading to numbness in the fingers. Diagnosis is generally made through simple X-ray tests; however, in cases of severe joint involvement, a computerized tomography (CT) scan may be necessary. The treatment for wrist fractures usually involves manually realigning the fractured bone and immobilizing it with a plaster cast. If realignment is difficult or if the cast is not effective, surgical intervention may be required. After treatment, ongoing joint exercises and finger exercises are necessary, especially if the fracture is related to osteoporosis, requiring additional testing and treatment. To prevent wrist fractures, it is recommended to wear gloves or other protective gear to maintain balance to prevent falls. To prevent slips and falls on slippery surfaces like bathroom floors, it is important to keep them dry or use mats. In dark environments, ensure proper lighting to prevent accidents and keep the surroundings organized to prevent tripping over objects. When using stairs, it is advisable to hold onto handrails for support while going up or down. When engaging in activities like snowboarding, skiing, or inline skating, wearing wrist guards is crucial. Also, maintaining a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D through foods like anchovies, milk, seaweed, oysters, salmon, clams, shrimp, beans, tofu, kelp, walnuts, sea cucumbers, cabbage, barley, brown rice, etc., is recommended.
