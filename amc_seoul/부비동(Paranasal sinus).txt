There are different types such as maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and ethmoid sinuses. They are located inside the skull around the nose. Sinuses are air-filled spaces inside the facial bones. The inner walls are covered with mucous membranes and connected to the nasal passages through small openings called ostia. There are four regions based on their location: Frontal sinuses (Frontal sinuses): Located in the forehead bones and are found on both sides near the eyebrows. Sphenoid sinuses (Sphenoid sinuses): Located between the eyes above the nose bones. They are divided into several smaller spaces. Ethmoid sinuses (Ethmoid sinuses): Located deep inside above the eyes, at the back of the sinuses. Maxillary sinuses (Maxillary sinuses): Located below the eyes and in the upper jaw area. They are the largest sinuses found in the cheeks. Sinuses warm and humidify air that enters from the outside through the natural openings connected to the nasal passages, helping with pressure regulation in the nasal cavities. They also help push the secretions produced by the mucous membranes out through the natural openings, but inflammation may occur and lead to sinusitis if the secretions are not properly expelled from the nasal passages due to various reasons, causing the accumulation of secretions and possibly resulting in sinus infections. They provide a lighter structure to the skull and protect the eyes and brain. They also play a role in shaping the voice during vocalization. Rinsing the nasal cavity with saline solution can be helpful, but rinsing the nose with saline or hypertonic solution can damage the nasal mucosa and worsen the condition. Why do noses bleed? The most common cause of nosebleeds is scratching the nose with fingers, leading to mild bleeding at the front of the nasal septum. Nosebleeds can also occur more frequently in cases of dry nasal mucosa in the same area. Intranasal steroids or antihistamines can cause nasal bleeding. Therefore, patients should be aware of appropriate nasal spray techniques, such as spraying outward to prevent direct contact with the nasal septum and minimize the risk of bleeding. Nasal bleeding can also result from direct injuries to the nasal bones or septum, as well as viral or bacterial sinusitis. Although rare, tumors can also lead to bleeding. Systemic blood clotting disorders, benign vascular tumors, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia can cause severe recurrent bleeding.
