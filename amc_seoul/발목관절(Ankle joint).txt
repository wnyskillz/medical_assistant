The ankle joint that connects the lower part of the calf bone (fibula) and the shin bone (tibia) to the ankle bone, allowing for bending and flexing movements of the foot. It is located between the leg and the foot, connecting the two parts. The calf bone, shin bone, and ankle bone come together to form the joint, with the calf bone and shin bone above the ankle joint and the ankle bone below it. Strong ligaments on the inside of the joint and relatively weaker ligaments on the outside maintain the ankle joint. Spraining the ankle occurs when a sudden weight is applied to the ankle ligaments, causing damage; this is called an ankle sprain. Fractures at the ankle usually occur when the body's weight leans outward and presses the outer edge of the ankle bone. The ankle joint allows movement in two directions, inward and outward from the central position at angles of 45 degrees inward and 20 degrees outward. The fibula on both sides of the ankle provide stability to the joint and support the body's weight. Strong muscles in front and back of the ankle joint enable up and down movements of the ankle by 30 degrees through contraction and relaxation. While descending during hiking, ankle injuries often occur. Pushing speed or running downhill because it feels easier can unnecessarily strain the ankle, knees, and back, potentially causing joint injuries. When hiking, it is best to descend with a smaller stride, suppressing excessive pace, especially when going downhill. Before starting a hike again after a break, check the condition of the knees and ankles before proceeding. Most ankle sprains are primarily treated conservatively, with the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) being the initial course of action. In cases of severe ankle instability from a sprain, a longer immobilization period may be necessary. Using home remedies hoping for the swelling to diminish initially can lead to instability, chronic pain, and other complications later on, emphasizing the importance of seeking proper treatment.
