This is a part connected to the respiratory bronchioles and associated with numerous capillaries exchanging gases of oxygen and carbon dioxide in a small pocket shape. It is located within the thoracic cavity, under the rib cage, at the end of the bronchioles branching out from the bronchi of both lungs. The alveoli consist of a single layer of cells that are empty and shaped like small sacs that are combined to form a cluster resembling a bunch of grapes, and they are connected to the terminal respiratory bronchioles. The outer surface of the alveoli is enveloped by a single layer of capillaries, and the extensive surface area where alveolar walls meet capillaries is very large. This wide surface area and thin membrane allow for a rapid exchange of large amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in a short time. At the end of each respiratory bronchiole, there are 50-100 alveoli connected, totaling 300-500 million alveoli participating in gas exchange. Alveoli are divided into two types: type 1 alveolar cells, which are flattened epithelial cells making up the wall in contact with air and contain pores facilitating gas exchange between alveoli, and type 2 alveolar cells located between alveoli generate surfactant, which reduces surface tension to help the lungs expand and contract more easily. With a single layer of epithelial cells and a single layer of endothelium forming capillaries closely adhered to alveolar walls, a thin double-layered cellular membrane allows for the passage of oxygen and carbon dioxide for gas exchange. Oxygen entering the alveoli is transported out of the body through capillaries from the alveolar cells, while carbon dioxide produced in the body enters back into the alveoli through capillaries and is exhaled through respiration. Gas exchange within the alveoli occurs based on the principle of diffusion from areas of high gas concentration to low gas concentration. Alveolar macrophages within alveoli face hindrances in gas exchange due to various factors, such as tar, silica, asbestos, nicotine from smoking depositing in the airways and sticking to alveolar walls, inhibiting gas exchange. Respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants occurs when pulmonary surfactant is insufficiently produced or absent, causing the alveoli not to expand properly, leading to breathing difficulties. Pulmonary surfactant is ideally secreted sufficiently by 34 weeks of gestation to function properly, but in premature infants, inadequate surfactant secretion makes gas exchange difficult in the lungs, causing respiratory distress. Nowadays, various treatment methods such as administering steroids to pregnant women before delivery and providing artificial pulmonary surfactant have significantly reduced the mortality rate from respiratory distress syndrome in newborns. Pulmonary emphysema occurs when the alveolar walls are damaged, causing the alveoli to burst and enlarge, making it difficult to breathe even when inhaling or exhaling, leading to a condition called pulmonary emphysema. The biggest cause of pulmonary emphysema is smoking, as cigarette smoke contains over 400 harmful substances that continuously irritate the bronchial mucosa and damage alveolar cells with toxic compounds making them burst. As the burst alveolar walls do not regenerate easily, quitting smoking in advance is crucial to prevent damage to alveoli.
