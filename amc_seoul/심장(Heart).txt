The heart pumps oxygen-rich blood throughout the body and contracts about 60-100 times per minute. The heart is composed of 2 atria and 2 ventricles, with valves between them to prevent blood backflow. Positioned on the left side of the chest, with about 2/3 to the left and 1/3 to the right from the sternum. The heart is divided into 4 chambers; the upper two are atria and the lower two are ventricles. The atria and ventricles are separated so blood does not mix, with left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, and right ventricle. Blood from the superior and inferior vena cava enters the heart. The heart receives blood in the right atrium, pumps it into the pulmonary artery through the contraction of the right ventricle. Oxygenated arterial blood is received through the pulmonary vein after gas exchange in the lung capillaries. It receives oxygenated blood from the left atrium and pumps it into the aorta through the contraction of the left ventricle. There are valves between the 4 chambers to prevent backflow: tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve, and aortic valve. The heart wall consists of the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The thickness of the myocardium varies with force, with the thickest layer surrounding the left ventricle responsible for pumping blood to the body, and the atrial walls are relatively thin. The endocardium covers the heart valves. The heart plays an essential role in maintaining life by circulating blood throughout the body through contraction and relaxation. Oxygen-depleted venous blood from the body enters the right atrium and is pumped through the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Blood sufficiently oxygenated in the lungs then enters the left atrium and ventricle before being distributed throughout the body via the aorta. Blood pressure refers to the pressure of blood within the arteries when ejected from the heart. When the heart contracts and blood is pushed into the arteries, it is called systolic blood pressure, and when the heart relaxes and fills with blood, it is called diastolic blood pressure. For accurate blood pressure measurement, it is essential to be stable for at least 5 minutes. Sit comfortably with your back supported and arm resting at heart level for measurement. The cuff should be placed about 2 cm above the elbow crease and fit snugly, with room for one finger to fit comfortably. Blood pressure can vary depending on factors like measurement time, location, position, stress, and activity. To obtain accurate readings, it is recommended to measure blood pressure at least twice with a 2-minute interval, and repeat measurements every 2-3 days. Exercise, smoking, coffee, and alcohol consumption can affect blood pressure measurements.
