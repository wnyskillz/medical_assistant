It is approximately 30cm long and is the second largest bone in the human skeleton after the femur. Located between the knee and ankle, it is positioned on the inner side of the calf bone. The shin bone is the largest bone in the human body after the femur. Above the shin bone forms the thigh bone and knee joint, and the shin bone is connected to the knee ligaments. Below, it forms the ankle joint with the heel bone. The ends of the shin bone that form the joint are widely expanded to support the lower leg more stably. Near the ankle, there is an inwardly expanded area at the end of the shin bone called the medial malleolus. The shin bone bears and supports the heaviest weight in the body and contributes to movement. The shin bone can fracture due to traffic accidents, injuries during exercise, falls, skiing accidents, etc. It may fracture alone or along with the calf bone. In severe cases, the shape of the fractured area may deform. If a fracture is suspected, it is important not to move the broken leg until emergency medical personnel arrive. Moving the fractured area without immobilization can cause more severe damage to the soft tissues due to sharp bone fragments. When the patient needs to be moved, it is advisable to immobilize the leg from the thigh to the ankle and frequently check the blood circulation in the foot and leg.
