Mast cells are mononuclear cells widely distributed in organs, connective tissues, and body fluids such as the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, bone marrow, bone tissue, and nervous system. The shape of the cell changes depending on its functional state and is not consistent. They are located within the tissues of the body. Mast cells are cells derived from mononuclear cells in the bone marrow. The morphology of mast cells varies depending on where they proliferate and how in the body, and they do not have a constant shape. They are around 20Î¼m in size and can be observed individually or in groups. The borders of the cytoplasm are not clear, the cytoplasm contains abundant granules with hydrolytic enzymes, and there are numerous small protrusions on the surface. They exist in a stationary state under normal circumstances, but when stimulated in peripheral blood, they migrate to tissues and play a role in picking up cellular debris or foreign objects. They release a substance called cytokine in many tissues to defend the body and trigger immune responses that cause disease.
