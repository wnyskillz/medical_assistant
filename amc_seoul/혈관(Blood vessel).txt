Blood vessels can be divided into arteries, capillaries, and veins. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body, while capillaries supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues and collect carbon dioxide and waste. Veins return filtered carbon dioxide and waste from tissues back to the heart. Arteries branch out into major arteries, arterioles, and capillaries to deliver oxygen-rich blood. Arteries are composed of three layers: the inner layer, middle layer, and outer layer. Arteries have thick walls compared to veins because they carry blood directly from the heart and have higher blood pressure. Veins have similar wall structure to arteries but have thinner walls due to lower blood pressure. Veins have valves to help blood flow only toward the heart. Capillaries, of which there are over 10 billion in the body, exchange nutrients and waste between blood and tissues. They are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells and have a diameter of about 0.2mm. Blood vessels transport oxygenated blood from the heart to organs and tissues throughout the body, and return deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Problems with blood vessels can lead to circulation issues causing conditions like ischemia and necrosis. Lifestyle factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, alcohol, smoking, high-fat diets, and excessive salt intake can lead to blockages in blood vessels. Therefore, it is important to improve lifestyle habits such as abstaining from alcohol and smoking, exercising, improving diet, and reducing weight in order to maintain vascular health. Veins have valves to assist blood flow in one direction towards the heart. If there are issues with these valves, veins can become dilated and thickened, resulting in varicose veins. Varicose veins can be caused by valve abnormalities in veins or conditions like pregnancy, vascular abnormalities, or deep vein thrombosis. Symptoms of varicose veins may include visible bulging veins, pain, warmth, and itchiness. To prevent and treat varicose veins, it is recommended to avoid crossing legs and wear compression stockings to improve blood flow. Severe cases may require laser or surgical treatment.
