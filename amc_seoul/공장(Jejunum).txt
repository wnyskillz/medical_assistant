Located in the upper left part of the small intestine (jejunum), the duodenum is the section that is mostly involved in the digestion and absorption of food without distinct borders with the jejunum. The jejunum, also known as the "factory" that is usually empty, is positioned above the belly button, behind the rear abdominal wall between the peritoneum and mesentery. Comprised of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, the jejunum forms a continuous tube-like structure with no clear anatomical distinctions between its parts. Both the jejunum and ileum are composed of the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, and serosa, with four layers in total. 

The second part of the jejunum, approximately 2.5m in length, accounts for about 40% of the jejunum excluding the duodenum. The jejunum is slightly thicker than the ileum, with a thicker wall, abundant folds and blood vessels in the mucosa, and approximately 3600 villi distributed closely, creating an absorption surface area eight times larger than that of the ileum. Due to its active absorption, the jejunum displays a folded and villous form. Between the villi, there are crypts that can secrete intestinal fluid, composed of various digestive enzymes. Food undergoes segmentation, being mechanically broken down into smaller portions. This movement is primarily driven by circular muscle contractions and mixes the digestive enzymes and contents thoroughly. Peristalsis, involving contractions and relaxations, mixes the contents within the intestines and propels them towards the rectum in coordinated movements. 

The majority of digested nutrients are absorbed through the villi of the jejunum; the absorbed nutrients enter into lymph vessels and capillaries and the passage of food through the jejunum typically takes about 3 to 6 hours. The mucosa secretes mucus to protect the jejunum from the acidic gastric juices and the intestinal fluid secreted by the jejunum contains various digestive enzymes that break down nutrients. Intestinal fluid secretion is regulated by mechanical and chemical stimuli and the autonomic nervous system. Various surgical methods, such as gastrojejunostomy, can be used to aid in the digestion process after removing part of the stomach. A method known as "jejunojejunostomy" involves connecting the cut ends of the jejunum after removing parts of the stomach. This method allows food to pass directly from the remaining stomach into the jejunum, increasing the risk of gastroesophageal reflux due to the backward flow of bile and pancreatic juice.

To bypass the flow of bile, a roux-en-Y procedure can be performed. In cases where the upper part of the stomach experiences problems due to conditions like neurological disorders causing intestinal obstruction, direct feeding route from the abdominal skin to the jejunum known as a jejunostomy may be created. This method can serve as a direct treatment or to facilitate upper gastrointestinal procedures.
