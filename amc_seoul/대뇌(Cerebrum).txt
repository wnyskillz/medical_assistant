The brain, which occupies most of the brain and is composed of two hemispheres, performs functions such as sensation, perception, movement, skills, imagination, reasoning, language ability, insight, autonomic nervous system regulation, hormone regulation, and homeostasis. It is located inside the skull and consists of two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum. The brain's protruding parts are called gyri, and the parts that are folded inwards are called sulci, which can be divided into the frontal lobe (frontal lobe), parietal lobe (parietal lobe), occipital lobe (occipital lobe), and temporal lobe (temporal lobe) based on their shapes. The frontal lobe (frontal lobe) is the largest lobe in the brain and is responsible for motor and language functions. Located on both sides of the brain, it mainly controls auditory functions. Positioned at the top of the brain, it interprets sensory signals. Located at the back of the brain, it is involved in visual functions. Below the brain, the pituitary gland, pituitary stalk, infundibulum, and hypothalamus are located. It serves as a relay center integrating the sensory and motor systems. It regulates the body's metabolism through autonomic nervous system control and hormone secretion, and is involved in motor control. It secretes hormones related to the body's metabolism and reproduction. Motor control involves sending signals about movements from the cerebral cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord, which are then transmitted to the necessary muscles, allowing us to move our bodies as desired. Sensory perception and interpretation function receives and processes signals from the body's sensory organs in the cerebral cortex, allowing us to feel them. Language communication function is performed in the cerebral cortex. The Broca's area of the frontal lobe is responsible for speech production, while the Wernicke's area of the parietal lobe is responsible for language comprehension. Homeostasis maintenance is mainly carried out in the hypothalamus, regulating the body's metabolism through autonomic nervous system control and hormone secretion. Learning and memory functions are performed in the hippocampus located in the temporal lobe of the brain. Hormone secretion function is carried out in the pituitary gland, secreting hormones related to the body's metabolism and reproduction. It has been medically proven that continuous alcohol consumption increases the risk of dementia by destroying nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. Alcohol suppresses the brain cortex responsible for memory and can paralyze nerves, leading to cases where previous events are not remembered after drinking. People who drink alcohol more than 5 times a week are about 7 times more likely to develop dementia than those who do not drink alcohol. Once brain cells are damaged, they cannot be restored, so maintaining appropriate drinking habits is necessary to maintain brain health.
