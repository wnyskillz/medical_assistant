The spine consists of 33 vertebrae, with 7 cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic vertebrae, 5 lumbar vertebrae, 5 sacral vertebrae, and 4 coccygeal vertebrae. As adults, the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae fuse to form the sacrum and coccyx. Except for the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae, sacrum, and coccyx, the vertebrae share a common structure. The 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae are modified to support the skull and allow for free movement of the neck. The other vertebrae consist of vertebral body, vertebral arch, spinous process, and articular processes. The muscles around the spine support, protect, and enable movement of the spine. There are seven types of ligaments around the spine, made of elastic fibers that protect the spine and maintain balance. Blood vessels and spinal nerves are distributed in the spine, transmitting sensory information to the brain and commands from the brain to the tissues. The shape of the spine forms a gentle S-curve rather than a straight line. The vertebrae are connected by intervertebral discs that elongate and absorb shock to aid movement. The spine supports the torso, assists in body movement, and protects the spinal cord and nerves. Scoliosis refers to the spine appearing curved when viewed from the front or side, causing asymmetry. Although scoliosis usually does not cause pain, it may lead to cosmetic issues, and severe curvature can impact the respiratory or circulatory systems, requiring treatment. Scoliosis can be diagnosed by observing unequal shoulder heights from the front and spinal curvature with protruding scapulae from the back. Treatment for scoliosis can involve corrective braces or surgical intervention in severe cases.
