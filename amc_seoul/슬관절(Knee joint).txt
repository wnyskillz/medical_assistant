The knee joint refers to the joint located between the bottom of the femur, the top of the tibia, and the back of the patella, which are the details of the bones coming together. It is located in the middle part of the lower body where the femur, tibia, and patella meet. All bones in the human body are connected to form the entire skeleton, where two or more bones meet is called a joint. Among them, the knee joint refers to the point where the femur, tibia, and patella meet. There is a joint cavity at the point where the bones meet, which is the largest joint space in the body, surrounded by meniscus that wraps the surface of each bone and synovial membrane that surrounds the entire joint. Additionally, the bones that make up the joint are connected and fixed by strong fibrous bundles called ligaments and muscles. The knee joint functions to allow natural walking by providing flexion, extension, and rotational movement of the knee. When you bend your knee, the ligaments elongate, allowing the knee to rotate or move, and when you straighten your knee as much as possible, the meniscus, ligaments, and muscles act to prevent the joint from bending in a different direction by fixing the joint in the direction of movement. The joint cartilage and synovial membrane surround the entire knee joint to eliminate friction in the joint, facilitate movement, and cushion impacts. The knee is a heavily used joint with well-developed strong ligaments and muscles, but it is prone to developing degenerative arthritis. When arthritis occurs, the weakened muscles around the painful joint make it more unstable when in use. Increasing the strength of the surrounding muscles through exercise can help alleviate the pain. The knee joint is prone to developing degenerative arthritis from long-term use, especially in individuals over 50 years of age, and factors such as past trauma to the joint, obesity, and excessive stress on the joint weaken the joints. Arthritis causes pain in the joint when moving, and as the condition progresses, the pain persists even at rest, the joint feels stiff when trying to move, the knee swells, and visible deformities in the joint occur. It can be diagnosed through imaging tests and arthroscopic examination, and treatment can involve medication, exercise therapy, or physical therapy. If conservative methods do not lead to improvement, surgical treatment may be necessary. Dislocation of the knee joint occurs when external impact causes the bone and joint to move out of alignment. When dislocation occurs, the entire knee externally appears deformed and swollen, and there may be concomitant damage to ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels, requiring prompt treatment. Treatment involves realigning the joint to its original alignment through reduction techniques and correcting the affected areas, such as repairing ligaments. Surgery for the knee joint may involve arthroscopic surgery for torn ligaments or damaged cartilage, or total joint replacement surgery for advanced arthritis. Osteotomy may be performed if there is misalignment of the knee joint. If the joint can no longer function properly, damaged joints can be replaced with artificial metal implants in total joint replacement surgery. The replacement may involve replacing the joint surfaces of the upper end of the femur, the end of the tibia, and the underside of the patella, and while replacement of the entire joint is common, partial replacements are also possible if only certain areas are damaged. Implants are designed to not provoke a rejection response from the body and to function in place of the replaced joint, with ongoing research and development to improve their effectiveness. After artificial joint replacement surgery, regular exercise is necessary to improve joint mobility and muscle strength. Exercise should be done 2-3 times a day for about 20-30 minutes each time, within a manageable intensity range, and gradually progressing in difficulty. There are various exercises, including leg extension exercises using the strength of the thigh to straighten the knee, calf raising exercises lying down, ankle flexion exercises lifting the ankle up and down, towel scrunch exercises placing a towel behind the ankle and bringing the knee as close to the floor as possible, knee movement exercises by pushing and pulling the foot while the knee is bent and the foot is flat on the floor, knee bending exercises sitting on a chair with the surgical leg on the uninjured foot and bending the knee as much as possible, and knee flexion exercises bending and straightening the knee without assistance. When able to walk, gradually increase activity using a walker or crutches.
