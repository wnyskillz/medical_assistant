The pituitary gland is a small gland located in the middle of the brain that secretes important hormones for growth and metabolism in the body, referred to as pituitary hormones. The hormones of the pituitary gland are regulated by the interaction with the hypothalamus, located just above the pituitary gland. Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus due to various reasons can cause issues with the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. The hormones are secreted into the bloodstream from within the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small endocrine organ located below the hypothalamus in the brain, consisting of two lobes. It secretes different types of pituitary hormones through the anterior and posterior lobes. The anterior lobe originates from the Rathke pouch above the mouth, while the posterior lobe originates from neural tissue of the fetus. The anterior lobe has five different types of cells that synthesize and secrete different hormones, while the posterior lobe is composed of neural tissue and stores neurosecretory material made by nerve cells, releasing it into the bloodstream when stimulated. The anterior lobe: consists of 7 types of secretory cells that respond to stimulation from the hypothalamus to secrete different types of hormones. It secretes 7 gland-stimulating hormones that activate endocrine glands. Growth Hormone (GH): Stimulates growth and development of the body's skeleton, as well as milk production after childbirth. Gonadotropins: Stimulates the gonads to produce sex hormones. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): Stimulates the gonads to secrete estrogen in females and helps in the growth of ova and sperm. Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Stimulates the secretion of sex hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): Stimulates thyroid growth and secretion of thyroid hormones like thyroxine. Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH): Regulates secretion of adrenal hormones in the adrenal cortex. Additionally, two hormones are secreted that directly affect body tissues without acting on endocrine glands. Prolactin (PRL): Develops the breasts, produces milk, and secretes it. Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (MSH): Stimulates pigment cells. Posterior lobe: stores neurohormones made by neurons in the hypothalamus and releases them when needed. Oxytocin: Stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth and milk ejection from the mammary glands. Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH): Stimulates reabsorption of water in the kidneys.
