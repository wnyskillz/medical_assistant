It is an organ that digests food with the help of enzymes secreted from the pancreas and gallbladder, located in the upper part of the abdomen associated with the stomach. It extends from the duodenum connected to the stomach to the posterior abdominal wall from the right of the first lumbar vertebra to the left of the third lumbar vertebra, forming a C-shaped structure. With a length of about 25-30 cm, it is connected to the common bile duct and pancreatic duct, secreting enzymes into the duodenum. There are sphincter muscles in the pyloric region to prevent food from regurgitating back into the stomach. The intestinal villi in the mucosa tissue of the duodenum secrete clear, alkaline mucus. Combining bile produced in the liver with pancreatic juice secreted from the pancreas, the duodenum is responsible for digesting carbohydrates into simple sugars, proteins into amino acids, and fats into glycerol and fatty acids. Bile assists in fat digestion while pancreatic juice contains enzymes such as amylase, lipase, and trypsin to aid in the digestion of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Duodenal ulcers are caused by excessive stomach acid secretion, while gastric cancer is a condition with low stomach acid secretion accompanied by atrophic gastritis. To prevent duodenal ulcers, it is advisable to avoid coffee, cola, and milk that stimulate stomach acid secretion, and to avoid overeating.
