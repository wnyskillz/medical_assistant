It is located at the lowest part of the face, below the oral cavity. Positioned at the lowest part of the skull, it shapes the lower part of the face. The mandible is an arch-shaped bone that initially forms as a pair at birth, then fuses at the midline around 1-2 years after birth. The mandible can be divided into the body portion that contains lower teeth and the branch portion near the ear without teeth. The body houses the teeth horizontally thanks to a structure called the dental ridge, while the branch portion of the bone extends upward to form the temporomandibular joint by meeting the temporal bone. The ridges of the mandible and maxilla come together to form the movable temporomandibular joint. Various muscles, nerves, blood vessels, salivary glands, submandibular glands, and sublingual glands are located around the mandible. In particular, a branch of the trigeminal nerve passes through the mandible. Supporting the lower teeth, the mandible works together with the maxilla in functions like chewing and speaking. The nerves distributed in the mandible area are responsible for sensation in the lower lip and skin. If you experience pain when opening or closing your mouth, stiffness in the jaw area upon waking up, habitually grinding or clenching teeth, frequent headaches or neck pain, pain around the front of the ear or temporomandibular joint, difficulty fully opening your mouth, it may be worthwhile to suspect temporomandibular joint disorders and seek dental evaluation. The leading cause of jaw deformities is believed to be congenital factors. However, the precise genetic factors involved are currently unknown. Additionally, severe inflammation or tumors in the temporomandibular joint area, fractures, oral and facial malpractices, and other acquired factors can also contribute to jaw deformities. The goal of treating jaw deformities is ultimately to transform functionally and aesthetically undesirable mandibular structures into desirable forms and positions. Orthodontic treatments performed around the 4th to 5th grade of elementary school for growth modification purposes include using headgear for cases where the upper front teeth protrude, and chin cup/face mask for cases where the front teeth are pushed backward. Jaw growth control orthodontic treatments are most advantageous when initiated at least one year before the peak growth period during puberty, considering the individual's growth and developmental stage. Precision examinations are conducted before orthodontic treatment to confirm this. Jaw conditions tend to progress chronically and because treatments may be considered elective rather than essential, patients often seek treatment from a cosmetic perspective even if there are no functional deficiencies. Therefore, treatment goals set by the patient and guardians must be harmonized appropriately with the medical professional's treatment approach.
