Logging in allows you to enjoy even more benefits. The oral cavity is divided into lips, mouth, pharynx, and in front of the mouth. It is located from the lips to the front of the oral cavity. The mouth is the first part of the digestive tract, with the lips in the front, cheeks on the sides, hard and soft palates above, and the floor of the mouth below. The sublingual gland, located on the basal surface of the oral cavity, and teeth aligned in the maxilla and mandible alveolar processes in the jawbones, with the submandibular and sublingual glands on the sides of the oral cavity. The teeth and tongue in the oral cavity play a role in breaking down food into smaller pieces and passing it through the pharynx to the esophagus. Saliva secreted by the salivary glands in the oral mucosa lubricates the oral cavity and mixes with food to initiate the primary digestion of carbohydrates. Taste buds on the tongue in the oral cavity allow us to taste flavors. Vowels resonate, create tone, and allow consonants to be pronounced through the movements of the tongue, soft palate, lips, and cheeks. The cause of bad breath can be divided into intraoral and extraoral causes. Intraoral causes include halitosis, dental plaque, periodontitis, cavities, and dry mouth; while extraoral causes include nasal conditions, pulmonary conditions, diabetes, liver conditions, systemic diseases, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Therefore, maintaining oral hygiene by brushing teeth, gums, and tongue can help prevent bad breath.
