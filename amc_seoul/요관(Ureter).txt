It is connected to the kidneys and extends from the lumbar region around the sides to the pelvis. It is a long tubular structure, approximately 25-30cm in length, forming a gentle S-shaped curve and connecting to the bladder. The ureter is connected to the kidney and starts at the level of the second lumbar vertebra, descending behind the peritoneum until it reaches the lower part of the bladder. The mucosa of the ureter is lined with transitional epithelial cells, covered externally by adventitia and smooth muscle. Urine produced in the kidneys on both sides flows through the ureters to the bladder for storage. The ureter plays a role in transporting urine from the kidneys to the bladder. As the ureter enters the bladder, it forms an oblique angle and creates a tunnel as it passes through the mucosal layer of the bladder. When the bladder is filled with urine and expands, the mucosal tunnel of the ureter relaxes and expands due to the flap mechanism, closing to prevent the backflow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys. This function also prevents urine from flowing back to the kidneys during urination, protecting the kidneys from pressure and microbial invasion. A ureter is a passageway created by connecting the colon and ureter to the abdomen for the discharge of urine when it cannot be excreted through the normal urinary tract due to conditions such as bladder cancer. A ureter requires continuous care to prevent infection and damage to the surrounding skin, as it stays in constant contact with urine and has a portion of its inner wall exposed externally.
