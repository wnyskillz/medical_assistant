It plays a role in storing bile generated from the liver in a small pouch attached to the concavity between the left lobe and the right lobe of the liver. It is located in the concavity between the left lobe and the right lobe of the liver. The gallbladder is attached to the concavity between the right lobe and the left lobe of the liver, and it is a long, slender pouch-shaped organ that can store about 30-50ml of bile. Anatomically, the gallbladder can be divided into the fundus, body, infundibulum, and neck. The fundus is the rounded end of the gallbladder, while the body occupies most of the gallbladder between the fundus and the infundibulum. The infundibulum refers to the portion between the neck and the body of the gallbladder, and the neck is the part that connects the infundibulum and the cystic duct in an S-shape. The gallbladder concentrates and stores the bile secreted from the liver, and when food enters the duodenum, it secretes bile to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats. If the bile secreted by the gallbladder contains excessive cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin, it can harden and form gallstones. Most gallstones are cholesterol stones that are greenish-yellow, and if these stones block the flow of bile ducts from the gallbladder to the small intestine, it can cause biliary obstruction and lead to symptoms such as organ damage, infections, fever, jaundice, and pain. In cases of gallbladder stones, cholecystectomy can be performed laparoscopically, and if the stones are located in the ducts, they can be removed endoscopically or dissolved with medication for treatment.
