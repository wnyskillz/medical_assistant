It is the part that protrudes in the middle of the breast, and in the case of women, it is the part where the baby sucks milk when breastfeeding. Located in the center of the breast, it protrudes at the center of each nipple. There is dark skin called the areola around the center of the breast, and the small protruding part in the middle is called the nipple. It is located at the very front and center of the breast, where the lactiferous ducts converge. The position of the nipple may vary slightly between men and women. In women, it is generally located near the fourth and fifth ribs, while in men, it may be slightly lower. Occasionally, the nipple or areola may develop in a location other than its usual place, known as polythelia or supernumerary nipple. The female nipple protrudes about 10mm. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, the size of the nipple increases, especially during pregnancy when the nipple darkens. Montgomery glands, which are sebaceous glands, are located around the nipple. In men, the nipple has no function, but in women, when the baby sucks the nipple, breast milk is secreted due to stimulation by the mammary gland being well developed. If liquid is secreted from the nipple, various causes may be considered. White discharge may be due to hormonal imbalances, while clear or brown discharge may indicate lesions inside the breast. However, it is difficult to diagnose diseases based solely on nipple discharge, so it is advisable to confirm the cause of the discharge through tests. Nipple pain can occur when a baby is born and starts breastfeeding for the first time. However, if severe pain occurs under any circumstances, it is not normal, and the cause of the pain should be identified and corrected. In many cases, nipple pain during breastfeeding is caused by improper latching, which can be alleviated by ensuring the baby latches correctly. However, nipple pain can also occur if breastfeeding is initiated late, the baby is initially given a bottle, the breasts are very engorged, or the baby does not latch properly. If the mother finds it difficult to correct the cause of the pain on her own, it is recommended to visit a hospital for medical consultation. If the skin of the nipple is dry, the pain tends to decrease, but if the internal moisture is not maintained, natural healing may not occur. Also, dry skin can lower resistance, so it is advisable to keep the skin of the nipple moisturized. During pregnancy, the nipples undergo changes in texture. In the first three months of pregnancy, the nipples may not protrude enough, but by the later stages, the skin around the nipples may stretch, causing the nipples to protrude. Occasionally, when pressing one nipple and it does not protrude or stimulating it does not cause it to protrude, it is called flat nipples. In such cases, a nipple elongation test can be performed to determine if there are no breastfeeding issues if the nipple retracts easily. If pressing and squeezing the nipple 2.5cm behind the nipple does not cause it to protrude and it remains submerged, it is called an inverted nipple. If only a part of the nipple is inverted, it can be corrected by pulling it out, but if both nipples are inverted, breastfeeding is done using relatively less inverted nipples. It is said that inverted nipples cannot breastfeed? When breastfeeding, it is important to ensure that the baby latches deeply, including the areola, as it is not enough to just suck on the nipple. Teaching the baby how to properly latch will not make the size or shape of the nipple a big issue. I have sores on my nipples. Is it okay to continue breastfeeding? Breastfeeding is possible. Sore nipples can occur due to improper latching, incorrect breastfeeding positions, the baby's tongue tie, or other factors. Breastfeeding is possible even with sores, but if the sores persist, breastfeeding may be difficult due to pain, so it is important to deeply latch on the nipple when breastfeeding or have the baby and mother face each other closely while breastfeeding. If there are problems with breastfeeding due to tongue tie, it is recommended to seek advice from a specialist. There are cases where tongue tie can be removed with a relatively simple procedure.
