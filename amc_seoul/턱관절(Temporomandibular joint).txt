It is located on both sides of the face under the cheekbones and right in front of the ears. The temporomandibular joint is formed where the lower jaw and temporal bone meet on both sides. Ligaments are attached to the upper and lower jawbone and connect with muscles, regulating the movement and position of the jaw. Between the two bones, there is a disc-like structure called the articular disc. The temporomandibular joint reduces friction and stimuli between bones, cushions impact, and helps maintain balance in the body. It allows the jaw to move up, down, and forward, enabling various activities such as opening the mouth, chewing, speaking, and swallowing. If you experience pain or noise when opening or closing your mouth, stiffness in the jaw area in the morning, habits like teeth clenching or grinding, frequent headaches or neck pain, pain around the front of the ear or temporomandibular joint, or difficulty opening your mouth, it may indicate temporomandibular joint disorder, and it is advisable to seek dental care. Resting in a comfortable position is essential when experiencing discomfort in the temporomandibular joint. Avoid hard or tough foods, move your jaw slowly when opening or closing your mouth, and refrain from opening your mouth too wide. Avoid clenching your jaw or putting strain on it, and avoid positions that stress your jaw. If the discomfort in the temporomandibular joint persists even after resting, it is recommended to visit a hospital for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Treatment for temporomandibular joint disorder may include medication, physical therapy, and exercises, and a change in the patient's lifestyle habits is necessary. Negative lifestyle habits affecting the temporomandibular joint include teeth grinding, clenching, biting, jaw thrusting, protruding the head significantly forward, constantly shrugging the shoulders, habit of protruding the tongue, improper posture, poor diet, irregular meals, excessive caffeine intake, lack of exercise, heavy smoking, and excessive drinking.
