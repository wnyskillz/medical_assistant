It provides attachment points for muscles and stabilizes the ankle joint. It is located between the thigh bone and the ankle bone, towards the outer side of the calf, behind the shin bone and towards the edge of the ankle bone. It is located between the knee and the ankle, towards the outer side of the shin. It forms the calf bone together with the shin bone, located behind the shin bone, and is the thinnest and longest bone in our body relative to its length. The shin bone and calf bone are firmly connected by ligaments and muscle attachments. The outer bump at the end of the calf bone near the ankle joint forms the ankle joint. The calf bone does not bear weight, but in conjunction with the shin bone and ligament connections, the outer bump forming the ankle joint provides stability against weight loading. Calf bone fractures can occur due to traffic accidents, injuries during exercise, falls, skiing accidents, etc., and both the shin bone and calf bone can be fractured together, or only one of them may be fractured. In severe cases, the shape of the fractured area may become deformed. If a fracture is suspected, it is important not to move the fractured leg until emergency medical personnel arrive. Moving the fractured area without immobilization can worsen soft tissue damage due to sharp bone fragments. When the patient needs to be moved, it is advisable to immobilize from the thigh to the ankle, and it is important to frequently check if blood circulation in the foot and leg is functioning properly.
