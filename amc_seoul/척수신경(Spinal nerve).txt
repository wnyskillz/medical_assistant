There are a total of 31 pairs of spinal nerves in the human body, consisting of 8 pairs of cervical nerves, 12 pairs of thoracic nerves, 5 pairs of lumbar nerves, 5 pairs of sacral nerves, and 1 pair of coccygeal nerves. These spinal nerves each split into a pair of anterior and posterior roots as they come out of the spinal cord, with the anterior roots carrying motor fibers that initiate movement from the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and the posterior roots transmitting sensory fibers carrying sensations from the posterior horn of the spinal cord. Running along the spinal column, these nerves divide into branches that exit through openings between the vertebrae behind the spine. Nerve fibers emerging from the spinal cord converge to form spinal nerves, entering through the intervertebral foramina. After passing through the intervertebral foramina, the spinal nerves separate into anterior and posterior divisions, with the front part assuming a thick form and the back part forming nerve fibers. The spinal nerves consist of a total of 31 pairs, including 8 pairs of cervical nerves, 12 pairs of thoracic nerves, 5 pairs of lumbar nerves, 5 pairs of sacral nerves, and 1 pair of coccygeal nerves, passing through each side of the vertebrae. Depending on the location of damage suspected in the spinal nerves, it is possible to predict the affected area based on the symptoms presented. Together with the spinal cord, the spinal nerves control all parts of the body except for the face and neck. The spinal nerves play a role in transmitting sensory information perceived by sensory receptors in the body to the spinal cord through the sensory nerve rootlets, which is then relayed to the brain. The sensory information that reaches the spinal cord is then processed to create signals for motor nerves that move muscles and signals that regulate secretory organs. Conversely, signals generated in the brain are transmitted through the motor nerve rootlets to the spinal nerves, issuing commands for muscle movement. The functions controlled by the spinal nerves vary depending on their location. Cervical nerves are involved in breathing, heart rate, and upper limb movement. Thoracic nerves affect the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, while the nerves in the legs contribute to lower limb movement. Sacral nerves influence pelvic organs. The spinal nerves also exhibit reflex actions independent of the brain, which immediately activate the body's movements in response to stimuli that could harm the body, without involving the brain. These reflexes cannot be consciously controlled as they bypass the brain. When a stimulus is detected at the terminals of sensory nerves, the signal is transmitted to the spinal cord, which then activates the nearest motor nerves to command movement in the stimulated area. A classic example is the knee-jerk reflex, often tested to assess spinal nerve function. Neurogenic disorders occur when damage affects the motor or sensory roots of the nerves branching out from the spinal cord. When a nerve is compressed, the corresponding muscle segment may lose reflexes or atrophy, and radiating pain may occur in the corresponding skin region. The primary cause is commonly intervertebral disc herniation, also known as a slipped disc, and it can also result from degenerative diseases like spondylolisthesis. If you experience radiating pain from your neck or lower back to your arms or legs, it is advised to consider seeking medical attention and undergoing a doctor's examination.
