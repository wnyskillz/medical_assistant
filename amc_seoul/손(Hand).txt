Our hand is made up of about 30 bones, including the wrist, back of the hand, palm, fingers, and nails. It is located at the bottom left and right of the arm. The hand is composed of bones, finger bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and more. The bones that provide the shape and stability of the hand are present in the wrist and fingers. Each finger has finger bones - the thumb has 2, while the other fingers have 3 each. At the tip of each finger bone is the nail, which is a modified part of the skin. Joints are located between the wrist, palm, fingers, and finger segments to allow the hand to move freely. Blood vessels and nerves are present in the palm and back of the hand. The skin on the palm is thick and structured to withstand friction and prevent slipping when holding something, with unique creases and grooves called fingerprints. The palm has many sweat glands, no hair or oil glands, and is rich in nerve endings making it sensitive to touch. The main function of the hand is motor function. It has a variety of bones, joints, muscles, and nerves that allow for delicate and precise movements and sensation. The flexor tendon and median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel on the palmar side of the wrist. If the nerve is compressed or pinched, it can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the wrist, hand, or fingers. This is known as carpal tunnel syndrome. A simple test to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome when there is numbness or pain in the wrist is the Phalen test. By holding the wrists together with the backs of the hands facing each other and maintaining a bent position for about 1 minute, if any abnormal sensation or pain is felt, carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected.
