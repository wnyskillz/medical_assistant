The uterus is located inside the pelvic bone, with the bladder in front and the rectum behind. The uterus is composed of a western pear-shaped muscle tissue that is about 7-10cm in size and weighs around 50-60g. The lower 1/3 of the uterus is called the cervix, and the upper 2/3 is called the corpus. The uterine wall is composed of the peritoneum, muscle layer, and endometrium, with the uterine muscle layer gradually developing and enlarging during pregnancy according to the growth of the fetus, returning to its original size after delivery. The cervix is located at the lowest part of the uterus and is connected to the vagina externally; it has more elasticity compared to the muscular corpus. It supports fertilization, nurtures the fetus to maturity, maintains pregnancy, and enables childbirth through uterine contractions at delivery.

It is a simple test that can be performed, and it is recommended to avoid it during the menstrual period.
