The hymen is a fold or membrane-shaped fibrous tissue located at the lower part of the vagina, partially or completely closing the vaginal entrance, and it marks the boundary between the external and internal parts of the female reproductive system. It is believed to play a role in protecting the internal genital organs from external stimuli, but its actual function is not significant. It is located at the lower part of the vagina. It refers to a membrane that partially or completely covers the vagina as part of the endometrium. The most common shape of the hymen is crescent-shaped, but the shape can vary from person to person. The hymen is usually a thin mucous membrane shaped like an oval band, with fibrous tissue and blood vessels beneath it. There is a hole in the middle part of the hymen, which may appear protruding at birth but grows in size as a person matures. Menstrual blood flows out through the hymenal opening, and in rare cases where the hymen completely blocks the vaginal entrance and prevents menstrual blood from flowing out, surgery may be performed to incise the hymen to allow for menstrual blood flow. The hymen can be easily damaged, so its role in protecting the vagina and internal reproductive organs is minimal, and it has no other special functions. In the past, the hymen was wrongly associated with a person's sexual activity, but this is incorrect. The hymen can be altered or torn even without engaging in sexual activity, and in some cases, the hymen can maintain its shape despite frequent sexual intercourse. Furthermore, some individuals are born without a hymen, so determining a person's sexual activity based on whether the hymen is intact during the first sexual experience is flawed. Situations that can damage the hymen include horseback riding, cycling, strenuous stretching, tampon use, and pelvic examinations.
