The sublingual gland is located in front and below the ear, the submandibular gland is below the jaw, and the parotid gland is located below the oral mucosa in the lower part. The salivary glands consist of the sublingual gland, submandibular gland, and parotid gland. The sublingual gland is the largest salivary gland, measuring about 4-5cm in size and weighing 14-28g. The submandibular gland weighs 10-15g, and the smallest submandibular gland weighs 2g. The saliva ducts are distributed on the lips, tongue, oral submucosa, and pharyngeal wall, having a small tube-like shape and directly connected to the upper respiratory tract and digestive tract. The salivary glands play a role in excreting saliva into the oral cavity through the ducts and produce approximately 1-1.5L per day. They help soften food while chewing, containing amylase to aid in carbohydrate digestion. They also transmit taste along with cranial nerves, serve as a defense mechanism against bacterial invasion through the oral cavity, and help soften the voice during articulation. The amount of saliva secreted per day mainly comes from the submandibular gland, and the amount of saliva secreted from the sublingual gland increases in response to food stimulation. The saliva secreted from the salivary glands supplies necessary calcium and phosphate for the teeth, protects them from harmful substances, and helps chew, swallow, and make sounds. When saliva is secreted in small amounts, it can cause a sense of dryness in the mouth, leading to xerostomia as a result of medication or chronic conditions.
