Beginning at the outer border of the sternum, it is located in the rounded breast encased by the front skin of the chest muscles between the ribs. The mammary gland consists of 15-25 lobes that fan out around the nipple in a fern-like shape, composed of fat tissue and connective tissue. At the onset of puberty, follicle-stimulating hormone secreted from the pituitary gland stimulates the maturation of ovarian follicles, leading to increased production of follicle-stimulating hormone. Follicle-stimulating hormone elongates the ducts inside the breast, increasing the size and firmness of the female gland. Simultaneously, the areola and nipple grow, and pigmentation occurs.

Upon ovulation, the secretion of progesterone begins, which acts on the terminal end of the ducts to help with branching. These changes typically occur within 1 to 1.5 years after the first period and continue to develop during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During adolescence, as fat deposits and fibrous tissue develop, the size of the mammary gland increases. The mammary gland in non-pregnant women is non-functional until pregnancy, where it produces milk. During pregnancy, ducts from the glands proliferate, forming lobules that expand. After childbirth, there is an active secretion of milk from the expanded lobular structures in the breast due to prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland.

The actual milk production occurs in the epithelial layer of the lobules inside the breast. At the peak of lactation, the mammary gland can produce and store up to 1/5 and 1/3 of the breast volume in milk, respectively. Male adolescents and elderly men may develop gynecomastia, characterized by the excessive growth of one or both breasts. This is mostly a temporary phenomenon during adolescence due to temporary hormonal imbalances between female and male hormones and often resolves naturally without the need for stress. However, if it occurs in the elderly population, consulting a doctor for evaluation is recommended. Drug therapy may have limitations in preventing progression, and surgical treatment may be necessary. After 2-3 days postpartum, the breast becomes engorged and firm as breast activity intensifies. If breastfeeding difficulties arise due to an oversupply of milk, leading to breast engorgement, pain, fever, and flu-like symptoms, it is advisable to continue breastfeeding.
