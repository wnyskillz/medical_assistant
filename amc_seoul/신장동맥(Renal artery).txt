A large amount of blood is transported to the kidneys, where about 1/3 to 1/4 of the blood sent by the heart to the body is filtered. The renal artery extends from the abdominal aorta located at the center of the abdomen, toward the inside of the kidneys, connecting all the way to the renal parenchyma. The renal artery connects to the kidneys on both sides, with the artery length connected to the right kidney being longer than the left due to the position of the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. The right kidney is slightly lower than the left, with the right renal artery located behind the inferior vena cava, right renal vein, pancreatic head, and the lower part of the duodenum. The renal artery leading to the kidney entrance divides into 4-5 arterioles, connecting to the kidney parenchyma along with veins and the ureter. The kidneys, paired organs located on both sides of the body, filter waste products from the blood and excrete them as urine. In this process, the kidneys also regulate electrolyte concentrations in the blood and control blood pressure. Blood entering the kidneys through the renal artery flows into bundles of tiny blood vessels called glomeruli, then releases water, electrolytes, and various waste products into the surrounding Bowman's capsule. The urine containing waste products passes through the renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, and urethra before being excreted from the body. The renal artery functions to dilate or constrict muscles to regulate blood flow depending on blood pressure levels. In cases of renal artery stenosis, the affected kidney secretes a substance called renin to maintain blood flow and increase blood pressure. Renal artery stenosis is diagnosed using Doppler ultrasound and can be treated with vascular procedures using balloons and stents if necessary. Even with a 75% reduction in kidney function, related symptoms may not appear. Fatigue, shortness of breath during exercise, and anemia may occur with a decrease in kidney function of 70-80%, while nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and malnutrition may occur with a decrease of 90% in kidney function. Further decline in kidney function can lead to seizures, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, coma, and even death. Symptoms may not appear until kidney damage has progressed significantly, making regular observation necessary for timely treatment.
