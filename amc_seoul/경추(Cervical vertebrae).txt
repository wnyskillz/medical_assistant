There are 7 bones that make up the neck, which is the smallest and most mobile part of the spine, responsible for movements like head rotation, nodding, and shaking. The neck is located at the top of the spine, at the back of the neck. The spine is made up of 33 bones, and although all vertebrae have the same basic shape, their forms and functions vary depending on their location. 

Among the seven vertebrae in the cervical spine, it is easy to move due to its overall shape resembling the letter "C" compared to other parts of the spine such as the thoracic or lumbar spine. The upper part of the cervical spine is connected to the skull, and the lower part is connected to the thoracic spine. The typical structure of the spine consists of a vertebral body occupying a large volume at the front and vertebral foramen at the back, which forms the structure of the bony ring called the vertebral arch. There are transverse processes on each side of the vertebral arch, and spinous processes protruding backwards. The spinal cord passes through the vertebral foramen and connects with the central nervous tissue inside the skull. 

The first and second vertebrae of the cervical spine, unlike typical vertebrae, are called the atlas and axis, and there is no intervertebral disc between them. The atlas is thick in the front and thin in the back, shaped like a ring without a vertebral body, while the axis is located just below the atlas and has a dens that helps with movement. 

From the third to seventh vertebrae, they are similar to typical vertebrae, with the seventh cervical vertebra being easily palpable from the outside. The vertebral bodies of the cervical spine are slightly smaller than other vertebrae, but they increase in size as they go down, and unlike other vertebrae, arteries pass through the sides of the cervical spine and supply blood to the brain. 

The first cervical vertebra, the atlas, supports the skull and is involved in the movement of nodding, while the second vertebra, the axis, enables the rotation of the head. The vertebrae are connected by intervertebral discs, which absorb the body's impact and protect the spinal vertebrae. As the nucleus pulposus, which makes up 80% of the disc, loses moisture with age, it loses elasticity and can shift from its original position, stimulating the surrounding nerve roots and causing pain. 

Such a condition is called cervical disc herniation, commonly known as a "neck disc." Good posture for the neck includes using a low and soft pillow during sleep, placing books at eye level when reading, and taking breaks to stretch your neck lightly every 30 to 60 minutes to avoid strain. Actions like carrying heavy loads on your head, standing in a headstand position, or repetitively rotating your neck to the side should be avoided as they can strain the neck. With the increased use of computers and smartphones, there is a rise in a condition called forward head posture, which causes neck and shoulder pain due to poor posture and lifestyle habits.

The normal structure of the cervical spine aligns the ears over the shoulders, forming a curved "C" shape, while forward head posture results in the loss of the curved shape, causing the neck to jut forward and lead to pain in the back of the neck and shoulders, headaches, and chronic fatigue. Stretching for neck and shoulder pain relief due to improper computer use and excessive smartphone use is recommended.
