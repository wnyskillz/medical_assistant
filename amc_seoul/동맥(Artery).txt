Blood flowing through arteries is rich in oxygen and has a bright red color. Arteries include pulmonary arteries, systemic arteries, aorta, smaller arteries, and capillaries. Arteries have unique characteristics compared to veins, with thicker walls that can withstand high-pressure blood flow from the heart. The innermost layer of an artery, called the intima, is smooth to allow blood to flow continuously without clotting. Arterial blood, pumped by the heart, carries oxygen to body tissues through arteries and returns to the heart through veins. Arterial blood from the heart travels through the aorta to supply oxygen to organs and tissues before returning as venous blood. The pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs for gas exchange, replenishing oxygen while removing carbon dioxide. Arteriosclerosis involves the hardening and thickening of arteries due to degenerative changes in the middle layer, leading to increased blood pressure and potential heart muscle changes. Coronary atherosclerosis refers to artery changes that occur only in certain portions of blood vessels, causing cholesterol buildup and potentially leading to conditions like angina and stroke. Lifestyle improvements through diet control, regular exercise, and medical intervention can manage these conditions. Lifestyle guidelines for preventing cardiovascular diseases include smoking cessation, moderate alcohol consumption, balanced diet with vegetables and fish, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing stress, monitoring blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels, and seeking immediate medical attention in cases of stroke or heart attack.
