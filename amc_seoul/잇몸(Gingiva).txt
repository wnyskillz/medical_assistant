It covers the teeth and surrounding area, located beneath the teeth. Gums are also known as gingiva, covering the lower part of the teeth where the roots are embedded. The healthy color of the gums is a pale pink, and when gum disease occurs, changes such as redness, swelling, and easy bleeding may appear. The gums can refer broadly to the tissues below the gums, and sometimes include the periodontal ligament that connects the bone and gums. The gums are mucosal tissue, but unlike other parts, some surfaces are keratinized, protecting the mucosa from damage even when in contact with food. The gums cover a wide area on the outer and inner sides of the mouth, protecting the teeth and oral cavity. They are firmly attached to the bone (alveolar bone) below, reducing friction when chewing and securing the teeth. Consuming foods that promote dental health is recommended. Avoid sugary foods like snacks and candies, and consume vegetables, fruits, and nuts rich in fiber. Be cautious when eating nuts by breaking the shells or cutting vegetables and fruits into appropriate sizes to avoid stressing the teeth or jaw joints. Eating hard, dry squid or tough foods can strain the jaw joint, so it's best to avoid them. Can gum disease be treated with over-the-counter mouthwash? Gum disease is caused by substances like plaque or tartar irritating the gums. While using mouthwash may help remove these substances, it usually does not effectively treat gum disease. Gum disease typically requires surgical removal of plaque or tartar through scaling procedures. Will scaling cause teeth to wear down or gaps to appear between teeth? Scaling is a treatment to remove plaque and tartar from the teeth without causing damage. By removing tartar, gum inflammation subsides, and swollen gums shrink. Sensitivity after scaling may be due to exposed tooth roots after thick tartar is removed, but it usually improves over time. Removal of tartar may create gaps between the teeth as the swollen gums recede, giving the feeling of teeth gaps. Larger amounts of tartar may intensify this sensation. Leaving tartar unattended may increase the risk of teeth falling out.
