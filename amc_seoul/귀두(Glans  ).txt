It is involved in both the reproductive function as the passage for ejaculation and the excretory function as the passage for urination. It is located at the end of the penis and refers to the rounded and bulbous part at the end of the penis. The glans is composed of soft erectile tissue without hair or sweat glands, but it has sebaceous glands that produce oily secretions. At the tip of the glans, the urethral opening is located. Surrounding the glans is the prepuce, which resembles a ring, and the narrowing part behind the prepuce is called the frenulum. The glans has abundant distribution of blood vessels, which leads to increased blood flow and expansion of the glans during an erection. The preputial skin that surrounds the glans and is attached to it is called the prepuce, and when the urethral opening is constricted by the penis, causing the glans to bulge backward, it is called phimosis. At birth, most individuals have the prepuce adhering to the glans, but as they grow older, the prepuce gradually separates from the glans, and after puberty, most of the prepuce can retract behind the glans. Phimosis surgery refers to a procedure that completely retracts the prepuce to expose the glans. The erectile tissue on the surface of the glans can expand and swell when stimulated sexually. Additionally, the urethral opening at the tip of the glans functions to discharge semen and urinate. What is commonly known as circumcision surgery actually refers to a procedure where the appropriate length of penile skin and prepuce is removed to expose the glans area. Circumcision surgery is not necessary if proper hygiene can be maintained, and it is only recommended in cases where an individual remains phimosed into adulthood or experiences recurrent balanoposthitis. Therefore, circumcision surgery is not necessary for all to prevent balanoposthitis, but it is advisable for those experiencing recurrent episodes to undergo the surgery to prevent further recurrences. If a child complains of pain when urinating and their glans appears red, balanoposthitis may be suspected. Balanoposthitis refers to the inflammation of the glans and the covering skin of the glans, occurring in children around five years of age who have not undergone circumcision. In most cases, regular cleaning with soap and warm water two to three times a day and taking warm baths will lead to improvement. However, if the skin tissue surrounding the glans is tight, balanoposthitis can recur, and in such cases, circumcision surgery can help prevent further recurrences.
