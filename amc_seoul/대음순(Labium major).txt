It is located outside the female genitalia and consists of two skin folds located on the convex part outside the female reproductive organs. Labia majora are structures that enclose the labia minora, clitoris, and other parts, with curly hair on the outer skin and sebaceous glands distributed smoothly on the inside. The part where the two folds meet looks like lips, with a thick front part, thin back part, and folds that continue from the front of the anus. The space between the labia majora is called the interlabial sulcus, with the labia minora located inside. The labia majora contain connective tissue, fat, nerves, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, etc., and have many pigment cells, so the labia majora of newborns are pink or pale but turn brown as they age due to increased pigmentation. Before puberty, labia majora generally appear flat, but they grow and protrude after the onset of secondary sexual characteristics. Occasionally, before the onset of secondary sexual characteristics, the labia minora may protrude more than the labia majora. The color, size, and shape of the labia majora vary from person to person. The labia majora, including smooth muscles and well-developed fat tissue with a thin fascia, absorb shock during sexual intercourse and protect the internal reproductive organs. It becomes thicker and engorged with blood as it is sexually excited due to the abundant blood vessels and elastic fibers, and it is highly sensitive to sexual stimulation. The labia majora, the outer part of the female external genitalia, is the part that is visible when wearing tight clothes like skinny jeans, and its appearance can change due to various reasons. Its shape may vary due to congenital causes, and it may sag or develop wrinkles due to cycling, wearing tight clothes, childbirth, sudden weight loss, etc. Enlarged and discolored labia majora can cause pain during sexual intercourse and indicate labial conditions, potentially causing discomfort for women, so it is advisable to seek medical treatment if there is discomfort.
