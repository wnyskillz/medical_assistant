Emerging from the lower part of the brain, they spread throughout the whole body without passing through the spinal cord. An exception is the vagus nerve which emerges from the brainstem and connects to the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Originating from the brain, these nerves connect to the peripheral nervous system, with each cranial nerve composed of nerve fibers, except the olfactory nerve which is composed of thinly spread nerve fibers. Most cranial nerves are mixed nerves containing both motor and sensory nerves, except for the olfactory nerve, optic nerve, and vestibulocochlear nerve which are purely sensory. Cranial nerves mainly control the head and neck, with the vagus nerve extending to the thoracic and abdominal cavities, governing the lower part of the neck. 

Cranial Nerve I: Olfactory nerve transmits the sense of smell originating from the nasal cavity to the brain. 
Cranial Nerve II: Optic nerve transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.
Cranial Nerve III: Oculomotor nerve controls eye movements. 
Cranial Nerve IV: Trochlear nerve controls eye movements down and out. 
Cranial Nerve V: Trigeminal nerve is involved in chewing and transmits sensory information from the face, eyes, and mouth to the brain. 
Cranial Nerve VI: Abducens nerve controls eye movements laterally. 
Cranial Nerve VII: Facial nerve transmits taste sensation from the front of the tongue and controls facial expressions, saliva, and tear production. 
Cranial Nerve VIII: Vestibulocochlear nerve involved in hearing and balance. 
Cranial Nerve IX: Glossopharyngeal nerve transmits taste from the back of the tongue, controls swallowing, and regulates saliva production. 
Cranial Nerve X: Vagus nerve controls sensory inputs from the throat, voice box, and outer ear and motor functions like swallowing, digestion, heart rate, and movements of the larynx. 
Cranial Nerve XI: Accessory nerve controls movements of the neck and shoulders. 
Cranial Nerve XII: Hypoglossal nerve controls movements of the tongue. 

Diseases where cranial nerve cells are damaged include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and more. Stroke patients have up to 6 months for recovery after onset, so immediate rehabilitation therapy after medical stabilization is critical for neurological recovery and muscle strength regaining. Early rehabilitation therapy can maximize functional recovery. During pregnancy, folic acid intake is necessary for the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. The baby's neural tube formation starts after 7 weeks of pregnancy, so taking folic acid slowly after confirming pregnancy can still be beneficial. Sufficient folic acid intake can reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Folic acid can also be supplemented through diet, with foods such as spinach, asparagus, seaweed, and nori being rich sources of folic acid.
