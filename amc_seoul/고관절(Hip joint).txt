It is located at the point where the pelvis and leg meet, and the hip joint is one of the parts that make up the lower extremities. All the bones in the human body interconnect to form the entire skeleton, and the point where two or more bones meet is called a joint. Among them, the hip joint is the largest joint in our body, formed by the cup-shaped part of the pelvis and the rounded head part of the femur. Specifically, joints are divided into fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints, and synovial joints depending on the type of tissue between two bones. The joint surface between the acetabulum and femoral head contains cartilage and fat that can cushion movement, belonging to synovial joints, and the ligaments that connect downwards hold the hip joint and femur firmly together to prevent them from moving apart. The hip joint allows for movement and rotation of the entire leg, including the thigh and calf, inwards and outwards. Compared to the shoulder joint, the range of motion is slightly less free. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which occurs most commonly in people in their 30s to 50s, accounts for the highest proportion of adult hip joint diseases in Korea. This disease, in which the blood circulation to the femoral head decreases and causes bone necrosis, is more likely to occur due to excessive alcohol consumption and steroid use, and causes pain from the groin to the thigh and knee. Although it can be treated with artificial hip replacement surgery, artificial joints have the disadvantage of a shorter functional lifespan, so if there is less necrosis of the femoral head, maintaining the original joint may be more suitable. Hip joint disease prevention - Good habits for the joints generally involve not moving the joints excessively beyond their natural range, moving in the most stable direction and manner without deforming the joints. Use the large joints of the trunk, arms, and legs when moving, and avoid standing in one position for a long time. Maintain normal weight with appropriate exercise and live a regular life. To achieve a good night's sleep, cover yourself with a light, warm blanket on a soft bed. Sitting against a chair is better than sitting on the floor, and comfortable clothing, low-heeled shoes, and thick-soled shoes are beneficial for the joints. Also, avoid standing for long periods in excessively hot or cold and humid environments, as environmental factors can trigger joint diseases. Good foods for the joints include legumes like tofu, bell peppers rich in vitamin C, bananas high in potassium, shrimp rich in vitamins and iron, antioxidant green tea, and omega-3 and calcium-rich smelt. Despite having a wide range of motion, the hip joint is protected securely by ligaments and muscles deep within the body, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of pain when it occurs. Pain usually occurs in the front of the thigh, groin, the sides or back of the thigh, and buttocks, often affecting a wide range. If symptoms occur, you should visit a hospital, and additional tests such as x-rays, ultrasounds, and MRI scans may be conducted to identify the cause. When the joint moves, the impact is dispersed to the joint and surrounding areasâ€”47% to the joint itself, 42% to surrounding muscles, and 11% to ligaments and tendons. Therefore, if the muscles weaken, the impact on the joint itself increases, making it more prone to joint-related diseases. Strengthening the joints through regular exercise can help prevent joint diseases. Hip fractures are common due to trauma, especially in old age when the risk is higher due to osteoporosis. Severe pain occurs mainly when flexing or rotating the hip joint, and the fractured leg becomes shorter than the normal side. The shape of the fracture is confirmed by x-rays and MRI scans, and appropriate fixation is performed. The prognosis can be poor in cases of underlying conditions, but generally, 50-70% of preoperative walking ability can be recovered, indicating a favorable prognosis.
