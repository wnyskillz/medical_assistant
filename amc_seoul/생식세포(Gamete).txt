Known as a germ cell in males and an oocyte in females, it is a specialized cell that is crucial for maintaining genetic diversity. Unlike somatic cells responsible for all parts of an organism excluding reproduction, it has half the number of chromosomes. Therefore, when a sperm fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote carries the full genetic information of both parents without change in the number of chromosomes. Reproductive cells possess the ability to create a new individual and serve as the starting point for the birth of future generations. Gender is determined by sex chromosomes within reproductive cells, with females having XX chromosomes and males having XY chromosomes. Genetic mutations, either inherited from parents or acquired later in life, are present in the DNA of all cells in the body. Mutations originating in germ cells are continuously inherited through cell divisions and passed down to the next generation. When a mutation-carrying gene is transmitted to the next generation through reproductive cells like sperm or egg, the mutation will be present in all cells. Therefore, genetic mutations can also be detected in white blood cells through a blood sample. Cancer, being caused by mutated genes, can be considered genetic, although only a very small fraction of cancers are hereditary. If a mutation is present in reproductive cells, it will be inherited across generations and present in all cells. However, most cancers are caused by unpredictable genetic mutations throughout an individual's lifetime, resulting from errors during cell division or exposure to environmental factors like radiation or chemicals.
