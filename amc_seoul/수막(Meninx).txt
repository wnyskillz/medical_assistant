The three types of membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord from the outside are collectively called meninges, with the outermost being the thick dura mater, below it the thin arachnoid mater, and the innermost being the delicate pia mater closely associated with the substance of the brain and spinal cord. The meninges surround and protect the brain nerves or spinal nerves. It refers to the connective tissue membrane surrounding the central nervous system composed of the brain and spinal cord. When the meninges of the brain and spinal cord are combined, they are also called the meninges. The meninges are composed of three layers referred to as dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater from outermost to innermost. Dura mater: It is the thickest and toughest membrane, consisting of two layers internally and externally. The two layers are the periosteal layer attached to the inner surface of the skull and the meningeal layer covering the brain and spinal cord. In the brain region, the two layers of dura mater are fused, but in other areas, they may be separated internally and externally with veins or nerve roots in between. Arachnoid mater: It is composed of delicate connective tissue resembling a spider web internally, and it forms a subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia mater. The subarachnoid space contains numerous connective tissue fibers that allow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Pia mater: It is the innermost thin and delicate connective tissue membrane that surrounds the surface of the brain and spinal cord seamlessly. It acts as a protective membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord while cerebrospinal fluid flows around the brain through the venous sinuses and into the heart through the sagittal veins. The dura mater is firmly attached to the bones and functions as periosteum. It also helps hold the brain in place between the cerebrum and cerebellum. The brain is protected from shock by the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. When the meninges are irritated, inflammation can occur in the subarachnoid space of the arachnoid mater, resulting in symptoms such as headache, fever, vomiting, neck stiffness, and even loss of consciousness. If infected with bacterial meningitis, despite treatment, 1 out of 7 to 10 people die. Even for those who survive, 1 out of 5 may have severe and lasting complications such as limb amputation, brain damage, skin necrosis, hearing loss, seizures, paralysis, etc. Therefore, the best course of action upon diagnosis is to promptly administer antibiotics. However, early diagnosis is challenging. Meningococcal meningitis presents with typical symptoms such as stiffening of the body and skin rash, but it takes 13 to 22 hours after the initial symptoms for them to appear. Prevention is crucial, so it is recommended to receive vaccinations for prevention.
