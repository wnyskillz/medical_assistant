The armpit is an area where fat touches and is a place where the apocrine glands are most abundant, so it is a place where a lot of sweat is produced. Axilla protects the armpit from friction to prevent chafing. Excessive sweating in the armpit is called axillary hyperhidrosis. For axillary hyperhidrosis, sympathectomy is often performed to suppress sweat secretion. However, compensatory hyperhidrosis may occur after surgery, causing hyperhidrosis in other areas.
