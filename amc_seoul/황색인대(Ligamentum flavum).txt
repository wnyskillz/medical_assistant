Logging in will allow you to enjoy even more benefits. It is a yellow elastic ligament that connects and combines the vertebrae. It runs along the inside of the spine. It is a short and thick ligament composed of elastin and collagen, which is more elastic than other ligaments in the body but has little regenerative capacity. It connects the vertebral bodies that are connected in a row (vertebral arch). The yellow ligament provides strong support for the vertebrae, limiting movement and allowing the spine to maintain its natural curvature. It also provides elasticity to provide mobility to each segment of the spine and indirectly protect the spinal cord. As you age, the yellow ligament may thicken and harden like bone, a condition known as yellow ligament ossification. Symptoms are often vague, with severe pain like disc herniation being rare, and patients usually complain of decreased leg strength or sensation. Conservative treatments such as rest and medication can lead to recovery, but if conservative treatment is ineffective or symptoms such as leg paralysis occur, surgery may be necessary.
