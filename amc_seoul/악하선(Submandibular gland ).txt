By logging in, you can enjoy more diverse benefits. The submandibular gland is a salivary gland that secretes saliva into the mouth and is the second largest salivary gland after the parotid gland. It is roughly almond-shaped, weighing about 15g, located near the lower jaw, with a pair on both left and right sides. Positioned in the front of both ears, it is located in the lower part of the jaw. The sublingual gland weighs about 10-15g and is the largest salivary gland after the submandibular gland. The sublingual gland can be palpated on the skin surface, and its duct opens under the tongue below the floor of the mouth to the lower part of the jaw. The sublingual gland secretes a viscous saliva due to a mixture of mucous cells and serous cells, compared to the submandibular gland. When food enters the mouth, saliva is secreted from many salivary glands. When the autonomic nervous system activates the parasympathetic nervous system, stimulation is transmitted to the sublingual gland through various nerve ganglia, causing saliva secretion. Saliva helps soften food, contains the digestive enzyme amylase to aid in digestion, and secretes antimicrobial substances, serving as part of the body's defense mechanism, helping to prevent tooth decay and periodontal disease. It also provides lubrication when speaking. The saliva produced is secreted into the mouth through the sublingual gland duct. The saliva produced in the salivary glands is discharged into the oral cavity through the ducts. The submandibular duct serves as a passage for the secreted saliva to move into the mouth, connecting all the way down below the tongue. About 70% of the saliva produced daily comes from the sublingual gland. The submandibular duct is long, with a large diameter and a slow flow rate due to the sharp bend angle the saliva must flow through. There is a high calcium and phosphate content in saliva, making it prone to form calcifications. Calculus formation in the salivary glands is called sialolithiasis. About 90% of salivary gland calculi occur below the molars in the submandibular gland, and the rest can occur in the sublingual and parotid glands. Smaller calculi may be flushed out by increased saliva secretion and gentle massaging of the area roughly 30 minutes after eating. If the calculi are located near the salivary gland duct, they can be removed through endoscopy, or in more difficult cases, through surgery. To prevent calculus formation, foreign bodies and bacteria must be prevented from accumulating in the salivary glands, as well as preventing calcification. The best way to prevent calculus formation is to maintain oral hygiene and ensure an adequate intake of fluids. Chewing gum or eating sour foods can also help stimulate proper saliva secretion. When the submandibular glands located in the front of both ears become enlarged, the jaw area may appear thick, and facial impressions may not look good. Even after undergoing facial contouring surgery or botox for square jaw reduction, if a frog-like face shape occurs with persistent drooling and reduced stimulation of saliva caused by spicy and salty foods, it may not improve. In such cases, injecting botox into the salivary glands can help slim down the jawline, and in cases where the surrounding muscles have also developed with the salivary glands, combining botox for square jaw reduction and salivary gland botox can be expected to result in a slim jawline effect.
