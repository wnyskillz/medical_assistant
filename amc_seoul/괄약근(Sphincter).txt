The ring-shaped muscles distributed throughout our body have varying sizes and lengths. There are external sphincter muscles and internal sphincter muscles that can be classified. The external sphincter muscle is a voluntary muscle and the internal sphincter muscle is an involuntary muscle influenced by the autonomic nervous system. The esophageal sphincter muscle allows food to enter the esophagus and prevents the contents of the stomach from refluxing. The cardiac sphincter muscle allows food to pass into the duodenum and prevents contents in the small intestine from refluxing. The urethral sphincter muscle allows the passage of urine, and the anal sphincter muscle aids in the passage of feces. Among the sphincter muscles in our body, the urethral sphincter muscle can be strengthened through exercise. Kegel exercises are recommended to correct urinary incontinence, which is the involuntary leakage of urine. Kegel exercises improve pelvic muscle contraction, reposition the bladder and urethra, and strengthen the muscles around the urethra and anus. It is recommended to start doing Kegel exercises lying down, then progressing to sitting or standing once you become familiar. When contracting the muscles, slowly count from 1 to 5, then release the tension without holding your breath and avoid tensing the buttock muscles. It is more effective to do them consistently and frequently rather than doing a large number at once, with around 20 repetitions three times a day being appropriate.
