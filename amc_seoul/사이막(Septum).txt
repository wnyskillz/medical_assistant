It refers to the central wall of the heart, located between each atrium and ventricle. The middle wall between the atria and ventricles is called the septum. During fetal development inside the mother's body, the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother's blood, so it does not use the lungs to breathe. Therefore, since the blood circulation that obtains oxygen through the lungs does not occur, a hole is present in the septum of the atria causing blood from the right atrium to flow into the left atrium. The hole in the septum is called the foramen ovale, and if it remains open after birth, blood from the left atrium flows back to the right atrium causing strain on the atria while also resulting in insufficient oxygen supply to the body tissues. In addition, defects can also occur in the septum of the atria or ventricles. The structure and abnormalities in the septum can be observed using echocardiography. The septum of the heart completely separates the atria and ventricles forming four separate chambers, allowing each space to maintain different pressures. If a defect occurs in the septum of the heart, there is a disruption in the sequential circulation of blood between the atria and ventricles. Furthermore, when defects occur in the atria or ventricles, mixing of venous and arterial blood can lead to an insufficient oxygen supply to the body tissues and organs, affecting their function. Depending on the size of the septal defect, symptoms may vary, and while some defects may close naturally, others may require surgical intervention. Procedures such as closing the septum by transcatheter device insertion or surgical closure via thoracotomy are available for treating septal defects. The choice of treatment method depends on the patient's condition.
