It is an important part that supports most of the body's weight and is maintained stable by the ligaments and muscles surrounding it. When you bend your leg at the knee joint connecting the femur and the tibia bones, it refers to the protruding area. The knee is composed of bones, ligaments, and muscles. It consists of the kneecap, thigh bone, and shinbone, and around the knee joint, the joint capsule is wrapped and fixed by the medial collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, and posterior cruciate ligament, maintaining the stability and strength of the joint. There is a crescent-shaped meniscus between the thigh bone and shinbone in the knee, which helps facilitate joint movement. The synovial fluid inside the joint supplies nutrients to the joint and reduces friction during movement. The knee maintains stability through surrounding muscles, ligaments, and cartilage, supporting the body's weight and allowing bending, extension, and rotation movements. Because the knee supports almost all of the body's weight, it is the joint most vulnerable to injury and osteoarthritis. Types of arthritis that can affect the knee joint include degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic degenerative arthritis. Degenerative arthritis is the most common form of knee arthritis that slowly progresses as joint cartilage wears away with age. Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition caused by autoimmune antibodies attacking one's own joints. Post-traumatic degenerative arthritis occurs after a knee injury. Treatment for knee arthritis includes exercise, weight loss, brace usage, heating or icing, medication, and if conservative treatments do not work, surgical intervention may be necessary.
