The thyroid gland produces thyroid hormones, which play a role in stimulating metabolism and maintaining function in our body. Located in the center of the front of the neck, it surrounds the trachea in a butterfly shape. The thyroid gland is divided into left and right lobes with a narrow isthmus in the center forming the butterfly shape. It weighs about 15-20g and has four attached parathyroid glands at the back of the thyroid gland, two on each side. The thyroid gland is divided into multiple lobes, each consisting of 20-40 follicles. The follicles receive blood supply from the thyroid artery that surrounds them. The thyroid gland is an endocrine gland that produces thyroid hormones and secretes them into the bloodstream. Thyroid hormones are essential for normal physical growth in infants and play a role in promoting the body's metabolic processes to maintain the function of all organs. Excessive secretion of thyroid hormones can result in increased heart rate, excessive sweating, weight loss, irregular periods, and protruding eyes. Insufficient secretion of thyroid hormones can lead to slowed heart rate, decreased sweating, feeling excessively cold, weight gain, dry skin, and other symptoms. Blood tests to assess thyroid function include T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and autoantibody test. Since many thyroid disorders are due to autoimmune diseases, identifying the cause of the condition and monitoring treatment progress can be done through thyroid autoantibody tests.
