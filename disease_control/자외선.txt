Summary: Ozone in the stratosphere, between about 13-15km above the Earth's surface, acts as a thin protective layer shielding living organisms on Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. A decrease in ozone leads to an increase in harmful ultraviolet rays reaching the surface. Ultraviolet Rays and Health Effects: Skin cancer is primarily caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or artificial sources like sunbeds. In 2020, over 1.5 million cases of skin cancer were diagnosed worldwide, with over 120,000 deaths reported. Excessive sun exposure during childhood and adolescence contributes to skin cancer in older age. An estimated 15 million people worldwide have been blinded due to cataracts, with about 10% potentially linked to exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Moderate exposure to ultraviolet rays is beneficial for health, especially for the production of vitamin D. Simple and effective preventive measures can be taken. Sunscreen is recommended when the UV index is 3 or higher. Artificial ultraviolet sources (laser, lamps) are used to treat patients with certain diseases (psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, lupus) that do not respond to other treatment methods. Q&A: Ultraviolet rays are electromagnetic waves that are not visible to the eye, longer in wavelength than X-rays and shorter than visible light. Ultraviolet A 315-400nm, Ultraviolet B 280-315nm, Ultraviolet C 100-280nm. When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, all Ultraviolet C and most Ultraviolet B are absorbed by ozone, water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide, while Ultraviolet A is not absorbed by the atmosphere. Short-wavelength Ultraviolet C is the most harmful but is completely filtered out by the atmosphere before reaching the surface. Medium-wavelength Ultraviolet B shows biological activity such as vitamin D production and skin pigmentation but can be harmful to the skin and eyes. Ultraviolet A accounts for about 95% of Ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface and can contribute to wrinkles and skin aging with prolonged exposure. The beneficial effects of ultraviolet rays include promoting the production of essential vitamin D which helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food and supports bone development. The World Health Organization recommends exposure to the sun for 5-15 minutes 2-3 times a week. Artificial ultraviolet sources are also used to treat patients with certain diseases that do not respond to other treatments (psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, lupu(...)
