Traffic accidents: After the 2000s, the number of traffic accident fatalities has been decreasing every year, but in '20, the rate was 6 deaths per 100,000 people, higher than the OECD average of 4.7, ranking 29th out of 36 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member countries. While the number of traffic accident injuries in Korea is decreasing, the hospitalization rate is relatively high indicating a higher severity level than the overall injury rate (15.9%). Among different types of traffic accidents, vehicle (passenger) accidents accounted for the highest proportion at 35.8%, followed by bicycles (20.6%), pedestrians (17.2%), and motorbikes (17.1%). Considering factors such as personal habits of the drivers, health conditions, age, vehicle defects, weather, etc., there are differences in the incidence and fatality rates, requiring a systematic prevention program and management policy that take these factors into account. Information on traffic accidents can be found in the national injury comprehensive statistics, discharge injury statistics, injury type, and cause statistics published by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. International organizations related to traffic accident databases include the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), International Road Traffic Accident Database (IRTAD), JTRC (OECD, ECMT Joint Transport Research Centre), and others. Children's injuries: Children's injuries refer to all injuries that can occur from infancy to school age in the home, school, outdoor activities, etc. Children are constantly growing and developing differently from adults, with pre-school-age children showing a high curiosity towards their surroundings and a strong impulse to explore due to their developmental characteristics, thus lacking the ability to maintain balance or fully developed motor skills. Furthermore, children lack the knowledge or judgment skills about dangerous situations and the ability to predict the consequences of risky situations, making them constantly vulnerable to accidents and resulting injuries. Injuries are a leading cause of death among children and adolescents worldwide, with over 950,000 children under 18 dying from injuries annually. Over the past 10 years, the discharge rate of child injuries in Korea has been on a decreasing trend, with the discharge rate per 100,000 population decreasing from 809 (2011) to 476 (2021) for ages 0-6, and from 903 (2011) to 545 (2021) for ages 7-12 (2021 discharge injury statistics). Falls and slips (42.6%) were the most common causes of injuries among children. Children's injuries show a consistent pattern based on development stages and locations of occurrence, making it possible to prepare and prevent safety accidents through proper education, continuous monitoring, and analysis. Particularly, many cases can be prevented through the vigilance and supervision of caregivers, thus emphasizing the importance of caregivers' appropriate attention, supervision, and understanding of safety rules. Injury prevention indicators: Emergency room visit rates and rates, number of emergency room users by reason for visit (intentional or unintentional), means of transportation to the emergency room, time taken to arrive at the emergency room after the onset of injury, duration of emergency room stays, emergency care outcomes, etc. Main indicators: Discharge rates due to injuries, discharge rates by injury mechanism, average length of hospital stay for injured patients, etc. Main indicators: Age-specific mortality rates due to injuries, mortality statistics broken down by age group, etc. Elderly injuries: Elderly injuries refer to physical or mental health problems or sequelae resulting from accidents, injuries, or intoxication excluding diseases, occurring in individuals aged 65 and older. Estimated elderly injury cases were 325,639, accounting for 38.4% of all ages discharged due to injuries, with women comprising 63% of the cases. The discharge rate of elderly injuries for those aged 65 and older per 100,000 population was 3,799 (3,237 for men, 4,230 for women), with women having a 1.3 times higher rate than men. Falls and slips were the leading mechanisms of injury among the elderly, followed by traffic accidents, collisions, intoxications, and cuts. Falls and slips accounted for 66% of hospitalizations in individuals aged 60 and older, with a sharp increase among those aged 70 and older. The average length of hospital stay for the elderly was 16 days, longer than the average of 13 days for all injured patients. Falls and slips among the elderly lead to long-term care and repeated hospitalizations, causing financial burden, physical decline, and increased risk of death in the long run. Elderly discharge rates by site of injury per 100,000 population showed that injuries at the place of residence were 2,065 for those aged 75 and older, about 3.3 times higher than those aged 65-74 (623), especially with women in the 75 and older group having about twice as many injuries as men of the same age. This was followed by injuries on streets/highways (787), farms (158), and water/seas/outdoors (87). Key indicators: Emergency room visit and attendance rates for injuries, emergency room users by reason for visit (intentional or unintentional), means of transportation to the emergency room, time taken to arrive at the emergency room after the onset of injury, duration of emergency room stays, emergency treatment outcomes, etc. Key indicators: Discharge rates due to injuries, discharge rates by injury mechanism, average length of hospital stay for injured patients, etc. Key indicators: Age-specific mortality rates due to injuries, statistics related to injury deaths by age group, etc. Self-harm and suicide: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1968, suicide is defined as an act of self-harm that leads to fatal consequences, while self-harm refers to intentionally inflicting harm on one's own body. Suicide is a serious public health issue occurring worldwide, with over 700,000 people dying by suicide annually, with 77% of global suicides occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Common suicide methods include pesticide ingestion, hanging, and firearm use. Suicide is deemed a preventable public health issue, and WHO (2008) designates it as a priority for global mental health, recommending national-level approaches to suicide prevention for governments, and the OECD compiles and publishes suicide mortality rates of member countries as part of its major health indicators annually. South Korea has the highest suicide rate among OECD countries, at twice the OECD average (11.1 deaths) at 25.2 deaths per 100,000 population, ranking as the top in suicides since 2004. In South Korea, suicide ranks as the leading cause of death for ages 10-30 and the second leading cause for ages 40-50 (2022 Cause of Death Statistics - Statistics Korea). According to the 2022 injury type and cause statistics (Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency), the proportion of individuals aged 10-20 in self-harm and suicide cases increased by 15.4% over the past 10 years. Statistics on hospitalizations due to self-harm, visits to the emergency room due to self-harm or suicide, suicide attempts, risk factors and methods of suicide attempts, etc., can be obtained from in-depth surveys on hospitalized injury patients and emergency room injury patients. Statistics Korea provides cause of death statistics including suicide deaths and suicide rates. The Ministry of Health and Welfare conducts surveys on the actual state of suicide, providing statistics on attitudes toward suicide, experiences with suicidal thoughts or plans, suicide attempts, motivations and methods of suicide attempts, etc. Violence and homicide: Violence refers to the exercise of direct or indirect physical force on a person. The number of injury patients hospitalized due to violence decreased from 30,736 in 2011 to 9,823 in 2021, and the number of fatalities from assault decreased from 552 in 2011 to 320 in 2022. Many cases of violence-induced injuries go unreported, and even if victims visit medical facilities, it is difficult to confirm that injuries were caused by violence if the violence is concealed. Therefore, the actual number of injuries resulting from violence is expected to be higher than statistical reports. "Cause of Death Statistics" provides information on mortality rates due to injuries, and this information can be accessed on the National Statistical Office's portal (http://kosis.kr/).
