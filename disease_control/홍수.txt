Overview: Between 1998 and 2017, flooding affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People living in flood-prone areas, in non-resistant buildings, or with a lack of awareness about flood risks are most vulnerable. Flash floods occur due to intense rainfall and can overflow rivers, streams, or roads. River flooding happens when continuous rain or melting snow causes a river to exceed its capacity. Coastal floods are caused by tropical cyclones and storm surges related to tsunamis. The frequency and intensity of floods are increasing, and severe rainfall and flood intensity are expected to continue to rise due to climate change. Health impacts: Flood disasters are becoming more frequent and are expected to continue this trend. The risk of drowning is increasing in low- and middle-income countries with weak evacuation or protection capabilities for people living in flood-prone areas. Injuries can occur from rapidly moving water or during post-flood cleaning, with cellulitis and deep skin infections being common. Cases of trench foot peak 3-4 days after a flooding event and can remain elevated above baseline for up to 3 weeks. Acute respiratory infections are the most common infectious diseases after a flood, as collapsed homes and overcrowding can increase the spread of respiratory viruses. Inhaling or direct contact with floodwaters can lead to waterborne infections. The risk of gastroenteritis is highest in areas with poor hygiene or insufficient clean water supply. Acute febrile illnesses caused by leptospirosis are associated with flooding and weather events. Leptospirosis cases have been reported in various geographical locations, including cities and rural areas in both developed and developing countries. In areas prone to vector-borne diseases, floods can lead to an increase in mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., Japanese encephalitis, dengue fever). The impact of treatment interruption varies depending on underlying conditions, with increased mortality rates after disasters for patients with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression can affect the mental health of flood victims. Loss of medical facilities can be associated with flood disasters.

Fast-moving shallow water can be deadly, especially for children. Always follow warnings on flooded roads. Do not drive in flood-affected areas, as vehicles can be swept away by floods, offering no protection. Electrical hazardsHuman and livestock wasteHousehold, medical, and industrial hazardous waste (chemical, biological, radioactive, etc.)Materials containing carcinogens such as arsenic, chromium, mercuryOther contaminants that can cause diseasesPhysical objects like debris, vehicles, and projectilesWild or displaced animals like rodents and snakesRinse the affected area as soon as possible with soap and clean water. If soap and water are not available, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer. Treat wounds and seek medical evaluation if necessary. Wash flood or sewage-contaminated clothing with hot water and detergent. If entering floodwaters, wear rubber boots, gloves, and goggles. Avoid contact between open wounds and floodwater. Clean open wounds with soap and clean water and keep them as clean as possible. Cover open wounds with waterproof bandages to reduce the risk of infection. Seek medical attention immediately if signs of infection such as redness, swelling, discharge, fever, increased pain, rapid heartbeat, confusion, or loss of orientation develop. Avoid exposure of open wounds to floodwater. Cover clean, open wounds with waterproof bandages to reduce the risk of infection. Clean open wounds with soap and clean water and keep them as clean as possible. Seek medical attention if the wound becomes red, swollen, or draining. Seek medical attention if the wound is punctured by foreign objects (dirt, wood, metal, or other objects) as it carries a special risk of infection (e.g., a dog bite or a wound pierced by a dirty object). Signs of infection include pain, increased tenderness, swelling, redness, warmth, and fever. Wash hands after coming into contact with floodwaters. Always wash children's hands with soap and water before meals. Prevent children from playing in flood-affected areas. Do not allow children to play with flooded and untreated toys. Do not bathe in water that may be contaminated with sewage or toxic chemicals, including floodwaters containing rivers, streams, lakes, sewage, or chemicals. Do not attempt to move propane tanks if found. Contact the police or fire department immediately upon discovery. Exercise extreme caution when removing car batteries. Car batteries may still carry a charge even if submerged in floodwater. Use insulated gloves and avoid contact with leaked fluid from damaged car batteries. To prevent fire, electrical shock, or explosions, disconnect home power and block natural gas or propane tanks. Never touch fallen power lines. Report fallen power lines to the power company. Avoid contact with overhead power lines during cleanup and other activities. Do not drive in standing water as there may be fallen power lines in the water. Q&A: Floods have the potential to increase the transmission of waterborne and vector-borne diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, so it is important to understand the risks and protect water sources. The most common risks associated with floods are contamination of water supply systems and stagnant contaminated water that can serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes, chemical hazards, injuries, etc. It is vital to know the evacuation routes and warning signals in the community and be aware of areas prone to flooding or landslides. Lower the risk of waterborne diseases by chlorinating or boiling all water used for drinking and food preparation. The most crucial preventive measure to take post-flood is to ensure continuous supply of safe drinking water. Wash hands with soap and clean water if in contact with floodwater. Do not use floodwater for washing dishes, brushing teeth, or food preparation. Avoid walking or driving in flooded areas as even small amounts of water can pose serious risks since it is uncertain if power lines are down or hazardous chemicals are present. Flooding can easily sweep away cars and people. Discard any food that has come into contact with floodwaters. Food touched by floodwaters is not safe for consumption and increases the risk of waterborne diseases. Safely clean flooded homes. Dispose of items like pillows, mattresses, etc., that cannot be laundered or cleaned. Clean all walls, floors, and other surfaces with detergent, water, and bleach. Protect yourself from mosquitoes. If water has accumulated in your home, use mosquito repellent and apply it to your clothing or skin. Also, wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts, and use mosquito nets to cover beds while sleeping.
