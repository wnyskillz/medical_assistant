Acute Myocardial Infarction: Acute myocardial infarction is a condition where there is a serious impairment or cessation of heart activity, often leading to immediate loss of consciousness or fainting. If acute myocardial infarction is not promptly treated, the patient may die, but with rapid reporting by witnesses, initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), emergency measures and transfer by emergency medical services, and appropriate treatment by medical institutions, the patient can be saved and fully recover without sequelae. Acute myocardial infarction can occur in public places where the patient cannot engage in self-rescue activities, and factors such as where it occurred, presence of witnesses, and whether early CPR was attempted directly influence the recovery rate and survival rate. According to the "Acute Myocardial Infarction Survey (December '23 public disclosure)," the number of acute myocardial infarction patients transferred by emergency medical services outside of hospitals was 35,018 as of 2022, the highest since the survey began in 2006. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency produces statistics on acute myocardial infarction patients transferred by emergency medical services from outside of hospitals through the "Acute Myocardial Infarction Survey (Nationwide Approved Statistics: No. 117088)," providing data on measures such as CPR performance and outcomes of survival and recovery. These statistics are also produced at the city and provincial level. Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): The rate of bystander CPR, a key factor in improving survival rates of acute myocardial infarction patients, has significantly increased from 6.9% in 2012 to 29.3% in 2022 and continues to increase annually. The rate of spontaneous circulation recovery before hospital arrival, reflecting the capabilities of emergency medical services in treating acute myocardial infarction patients, has also increased from 3.5% in 2012 to 8.2% in 2022. Furthermore, the percentage of surviving patients increased from 4.4% in 2012 to 7.8% in 2022, and the percentage of patients who recover enough brain function to lead a normal life increased from 1.8% in 2012 to 5.1% in 2022. However, despite these advancements, survival and recovery rates remain very low when experiencing cardiac arrest, emphasizing the need for efforts to improve the quality of emergency response activities and to develop and promote practical strategies to identify and manage risk factors for cardiac arrest prevention.
