Health impact of cold weather: Engage in light indoor exercise. Maintain appropriate hydration. Eat a balanced meal with proper nutrients. Maintain a suitable temperature (18℃~20℃). Maintain proper humidity levels (40%~60%). Avoid outdoor activities as much as possible in cold weather. Layer clothing and wear gloves, scarves, hats, and masks. Avoid excessive exercise. Elderly individuals who engage in excessive physical activity early in the winter may experience a rise in blood pressure or deterioration of cerebrovascular diseases. Children have a large body surface area and less subcutaneous fat, making it difficult to maintain body temperature. They are more susceptible to hypothermia due to a weaker compensatory response to raise body temperature than adults. Frostbite or hypothermia are well-known risk factors for chronic diseases, and sudden onset or worsening of cerebrovascular diseases, such as strokes or heart attacks, can occur during cold weather. Homeless individuals are at a higher risk of developing cold-related illnesses due to a higher likelihood of chronic diseases, alcohol or substance abuse, and difficulty in securing a warm place to stay. Move patients to a warm place as soon as possible. Remove wet clothes and wrap them in blankets. If the patient is fully conscious, give them warm beverages (excluding alcohol) and sweet foods like chocolate. If the patient is unconscious, do not give them any liquids as there is a risk of choking. Keep them awake and responsive until emergency services arrive. If the patient shows no pulse or breathing, perform CPR until emergency services arrive.Symptoms are mainly seen in the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Severe cases may require amputations. The skin gradually turns white or yellowish-gray. The skin becomes abnormally firm to the touch. There is a decrease in skin sensation, leading to numbness. Due to narrowing of blood vessels and increased blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes are common. Respiratory illnesses are also more prevalent due to dry and cold air. Joints become stiff in cold temperatures, increasing the risk of injuries from falls. Objective: Monitoring the prevalence of cold-related illnesses in winter and promoting public awareness and prevention efforts. Reporting Entities: Hospital emergency departments nationwide, around 500 participating institutions. Reporting Period: Annually from December 1 to the end of February of the following year. Reporting System: Participating medical institutions → Local health centers → Local governments → Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Reporting Timing: Reports from emergency room visits of cold-related illness patients should be submitted to the medical institution by 10 a.m. the next day. Data publishing: Results will be posted on the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency website by 4 p.m. daily.Types of cold-related illnesses and emergency measures: Adults: Shivering, fatigue, confusion, slurred speech, memory loss, drowsiness. Infants: Red and cold skin, shivering. Move the patient to a warm place as quickly as possible. Remove wet clothes and wrap them in blankets. Keep the patient awake and responsive until emergency services arrive. If there is no pulse or apparent breathing, perform CPR until emergency services arrive. Frostbite refers to tissue damage from exposure to extreme cold. It mainly occurs in the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Severe cases may require amputations. The skin gradually turns white or yellowish-gray. The skin becomes abnormally firm to the touch. There is a decrease in skin sensation, leading to numbness. Seek prompt medical attention for treatment. Move the patient to a warm place promptly. For the face and ears, apply a warm, moist cloth and change it frequently. If bacteria invade the damaged area, ulcers may develop. Itchiness in the affected area worsens when exposed to warmth. Severe cases may lead to blood pooling, blisters, and ulcers on the affected area. In less severe cases, the condition may improve within a few weeks without specific treatment, but medication may help. Soak the affected area in warm water. Gently massage the affected area to promote blood circulation, and do not scratch. Keep the affected area clean and moisturized. Initially, you may experience itching, numbness, and tingling pain. As the condition progresses, the area may appear swollen and the skin may turn slightly red, blue, or black. Over time, blisters may form, or tissue necrosis or skin ulcers may develop. Remove wet shoes and socks. Gently wash the affected area with warm water and dry it. Promote health guidelines.
