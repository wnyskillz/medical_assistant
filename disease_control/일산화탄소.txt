Overview: Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas produced as a byproduct of incomplete combustion due to lack of oxygen. It is non-irritating to the skin. It is a gas generated when fuel is incompletely burned in gas boilers, gas water heaters, gas stoves, gas ranges, gas ovens, wood, kerosene, paraffin, and coal heaters, as well as in portable generators and other gasoline-powered equipment. It is also produced in indoor barbecues or camping stoves, and in the event of gas emissions from cars, trucks, or buses. Inhaling carbon monoxide may result in headaches, difficulty breathing, and can ultimately lead to death. 

Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the lungs, forming carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and reducing the blood's ability to transport oxygen internally, leading to a state of internal suffocation. Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur when using gas, propane gas, coal, etc. as fuel, being in a running car for a long time, operating an old boiler, inhaling car exhaust fumes, or being in a fire scene. Camping inside a camping car or tent with a heating device can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. 

Health effects: Inhaling carbon monoxide forms carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the amount of oxygen that can be transported to tissues, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Carbon monoxide has an affinity for hemoglobin over 200 times higher than that of oxygen, so even in cases of minimal carbon monoxide inhalation, carboxyhemoglobin can form. Symptoms of mild carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, weakness, confusion, chest pain, muscle aches, shortness of breath, fainting, mild carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms often resolve quickly when moved to fresh air. 

If someone mildly poisoned by carbon monoxide falls asleep without realizing it, they may continue to inhale carbon monoxide until they are seriously poisoned or die. Long-term exposure to carbon monoxide from boiler or heater use may lead some to mistakenly attribute symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning to the flu or another infection. Symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headaches, nausea, dizziness, mental changes, weakness, shortness of breath, confusion, heart attack, heart failure, loss of consciousness, and death.

Prevention measures: Install carbon monoxide alarms approved by testing institutions around combustion devices. Maintain and regularly inspect home heating systems. Install gas water heaters outdoors, and carefully inspect boiler piping, indoor wood stoves, gas stoves, etc., for cracks or damage and ensure proper ventilation. Carbon monoxide can be produced by inhaling methylene chloride, a component of paint and polish removers. Therefore, be cautious as exposure to methylene chloride can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Check if carbon monoxide alarms are installed when booking accommodations or at camping sites where they are available for rent. If carbon monoxide is suspected in the home, open windows, evacuate outside, and evaluate the source of carbon monoxide before returning home. Identify and repair the source of carbon monoxide before returning home, if carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred in the home. Heating devices using LPG, fuels, coal, wood, etc., should not be used in enclosed spaces (tents, vehicles). Running a car engine emits carbon monoxide. Do not use gas ovens to heat the home. 

Q&A: Carbon monoxide is a gas produced when fossil fuels containing carbon are incompletely burned. It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-irritating. Carbon monoxide is produced in smoke from vehicles, gasoline engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas stoves, or heaters. Due to its characteristics, carbon monoxide is often referred to as the "Silent Killer," causing significant mortality and morbidity globally. Oxygen combines with hemoglobin, a blood cell, and is transported to cells. However, carbon monoxide has an affinity for hemoglobin over 200 times higher than that of oxygen. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide allows more hemoglobin to bind with carbon monoxide than oxygen, leading to cellular oxygen deprivation and carbon monoxide poisoning.
