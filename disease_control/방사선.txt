Overview: The process of particles or waves carrying energy propagating through a medium or space, released by unstable atomic nuclei or atomic nuclei to stabilize. Radioactive substances in the Earth's soil, water, air, etc., generate various types of radiation, and people inhale and ingest forms of radiation emitted from the air, food, and water every day. Even in space, radiation is being emitted into the Earth's atmosphere at a very rapid pace, with most disappearing before reaching the ground, but some falling as rain or being absorbed by plants and animals, eventually being absorbed by humans through respiration or the food chain. Artificial radiation: Radiation generated by humans, typically referring to X-ray machines used in diagnosis or radiation therapy, as well as radioactive pharmaceuticals used in medical devices. Radioactive material refers to the ability to emit radiation. Material that possesses the property of emitting radiation. Radiation in daily life: There is cosmic radiation and terrestrial radiation in the natural environment, and radiation is also present in everyday life such as air travel, airport security scanners, building materials, and smoking. In South Korea, the annual radiation exposure in daily life is about 3.8 millisieverts (mSv), while the global average annual radiation exposure is around 2.4 millisieverts (mSv). The average dose in each country differs depending on geological characteristics, regional radiation, etc. Utilized in improving breeds or developing new breeds by utilizing the mutation process that occurs when exposing plants' seeds or seedlings to radiation. Monitoring and managing the status of processes or products in industrial sites. Radiographs can be used to easily inspect the thickness, density, composition, etc., of objects. (Non-destructive testing, radiographic gauges) In South Korea, the annual radiation exposure in daily life is approximately 3.8 millisieverts (mSv), while the global average annual radiation exposure is about 2.4 millisieverts (mSv). The average dose in each country varies due to factors such as the geological characteristics and regional radiation. Radiation and health effects: Radiation can affect the bonding of atoms or molecules that make up substances, thereby changing the structure or properties of the substances. Therefore, prolonged exposure to radiation beyond what is necessary or receiving a large amount of radiation at once can cause damage to human cells, potentially leading to injuries or even fatalities. When the human body absorbs radiation energy, an ionization phenomenon occurs within the body, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species that can damage cells and organs by breaking down water within the body. Damaged cells can alter DNA and cause temporary or permanent changes in exposed cells (tissues, organs). If a pregnant woman accidentally swallows or inhales radioactive material, it is absorbed into the bloodstream. The radioactive material may be transferred to the fetus through the mother's blood via the umbilical cord or may be concentrated near areas such as the uterus (bladder), leading to exposure to the fetus. Fetuses are particularly sensitive to radiation during the initial developmental period between 2 to 18 weeks of gestation. Even low doses of radiation can have serious health implications for fetuses, including growth disorders, malformations, abnormal brain function, and an increased risk of cancer. Children and adults differ anatomically and physiologically, resulting in varying effects of radiation exposure. Children, having smaller body sizes and less protective tissue, would receive higher doses of exposure with the same radiation level compared to adults. If radiation impacts germ cells such as sperm or ova, it could result in genetic effects transmitted to offspring. The effects of radiation on offspring are known as genetic effects. Q&A: The process of particles or waves carrying energy propagating through a medium or space, in other words, the flow of energy emitted by atoms or atomic nuclei with unstable nuclei to stabilize. Since radiation can influence the bonding of atoms or molecules that make up substances, prolonged exposure to radiation or receiving a large amount of radiation at once can cause damage to human cells, potentially leading to injuries or fatalities. Radioactive materials released into the air can be inhaled into the lungs, enter the body through wounds, or be ingested while eating or drinking. This is referred to as internal contamination. Radioactive materials can come into contact with a person's skin, hair, or clothing, known as external contamination. During a radiological or nuclear emergency, radioactive materials are spread in the air like dust or sand. To protect oneself from external contamination, seek shelter indoors. The health effects of radiation on the human body are proportional to the amount of radiation absorbed, the type of radioactive material, how the radioactive material entered the body, and the duration of exposure. Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) can occur if exposed to a large amount of radiation over a short period. Seek medical attention immediately if symptoms such as skin burns, nausea, or vomiting develop. Children are more susceptible to the health effects of radiation exposure due to faster cell division and more developing tissues compared to adults. Following protective measures and receiving immediate medical treatment is crucial for children following a radiation emergency. Individuals exposed to high levels of radiation may have an increased risk of developing specific types of cancer over the long term based on their exposure levels. Inhaling or ingesting radioactive iodine leads to its concentration in the thyroid gland, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer. Those exposed can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer by taking potassium iodide tablets, but only under medical advice. For individuals exposed to low doses of radiation, the risk of cancer due to radiation exposure is so minimal that it cannot be distinguished from exposure to chemicals, genetics, smoking, or dietary factors.
