Heat Wave Health Effects: When the expected highest perceived temperature is 33℃ or higher for two days or more, significant damage can be expected due to rapid rise in apparent temperature or prolonged heat waves. When the expected highest perceived temperature is 35℃ or higher for two days or more, widespread damage can be expected in a large area due to rapid rise in apparent temperature or prolonged heat waves. Generally, exposure to high temperatures can lead to symptoms such as heat stroke, heat exhaustion, edema, sweat rash, convulsions, headaches, fatigue, etc., and it is known to have impacts on causing severe dehydration, cerebrovascular diseases, and contributing to blood clot formation. Acute illnesses caused by heat, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion, can lead to life-threatening situations if left untreated. Vulnerable groups such as chronic disease patients, elderly, and children can face the risk of death due to heat waves. The evaluation of health effects of heat waves varies in different studies, including overall mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and mortality due to kidney diseases. Patients with cardiovascular diseases are vulnerable to heat-related illnesses because when body fluids decrease due to excessive sweating, the heart is burdened with increase in heart rate and respiration rate to recover low blood pressure, leading to rapid dehydration, making them susceptible to heat-related illnesses. During the summer season, the body expands peripheral blood vessels and lowers blood pressure to regulate body temperature, requiring extra caution for patients with hypotension. In the summer season, to maintain normal body temperature, there is active constriction and relaxation of blood vessels, which can lead to sudden fluctuations in blood pressure (increases and decreases in blood pressure) in patients with hypertension, requiring extra caution during the summer season. Excessive loss of moisture through sweating can lead to higher blood sugar levels, risk of shock, dysfunction of autonomic nervous system resulting in decreased thermoregulation function, increasing the likelihood of heat-related illnesses. Drinking an excessive amount of water at once in hot weather can lead to edema or hyponatremia causing symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, nausea, and vertigo, requiring caution in the summer season. Heat-related illnesses include heat stroke, which causes loss of function in the body's temperature-regulating nervous system due to inability to withstand external heat stimuli. It can be accompanied by complications of widespread organ damage and dysfunction, with a high fatality rate, making it the most dangerous heat-related illness. Symptoms include central nervous system dysfunction (loss of consciousness/coma), dry and hot skin (>40°C) (in some cases, sweating may occur), rapid and strong heartbeat, severe headache, chills, weak pulse, shallow breathing, low blood pressure, nausea, vertigo, profuse sweating, and exposure to extreme heat can cause heat illnesses. Rest in a cool place or a place with air conditioning. If sweating a lot, replenish electrolytes (sodium), potassium, magnesium, etc., that are lacking in muscles causing cramps, especially when excessive labor or exercise causes muscle cramps (calves, thighs, shoulders, etc.) Rest in a cool place. as body temperature rises, blood volume in the body surface increases to dissipate heat externally causing a decrease in deep blood volume, leading to insufficient blood supply to the brain, temporary loss of consciousness when sitting or lying for a long time then standing up or standing for a long time, causing fainting (temporary loss of consciousness) if communication is possible, drink water slowly. Maintain limbs, feet, or ankles swollen due to blocked sweat glands or pores, resulting in accumulation of sweat that cannot be properly excreted into the epidermis, causing small rash and blisters. Keep affected areas cool and dry. Use powders, ointments, etc., for rashes. Symptoms include skin turning red from prolonged exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet rays) and developing inflammatory reactions, painful, red, and hot skin, blisters on the skin. Avoid sunlight until sunburn improves. Apply moisturizing ointment to sunburn areas. Do not burst blisters. Take frequent showers. Wear loose, light-colored clothing. Monitor temperature, heat wave warnings, etc., regularly and avoid outdoor activities during heat waves. Purpose: Monitoring of heatstroke patients in summer for prompt information sharing to promote public awareness and prevention activities. Reporting entity: Emergency medical institutions nationwide wishing to participate (about 500 institutions). Reporting period: Every summer from May to September. Reporting system: Participating medical institutions → Local public health centers → Local government → Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Reporting time: When heatstroke patients visit the emergency room, report to the medical institution by 10:00 on the next day. Results return: Announced on the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency website until 16:00 daily. Q&A: Wear cool clothes and apply sunscreen before going outside. Stay indoors as much as possible. Drink plenty of water, and if you sweat a lot, replenish electrolytes and minerals with ion drinks. Wear cool clothes at home. When going out, wear a wide-brimmed hat and loose, light-colored clothing. If you are not accustomed to working or exercising in hot environments, start slowly and gradually increase your pace. If your heart is pounding and you are short of breath while working or exercising in the heat, stop all activities and rest in a cool place. Using a fan on extremely hot days is not enough to prevent heat-related illnesses. Take a shower with cool water or move to an air-conditioned place to cool down. Do not take refined salt without a doctor's instructions. Replenish salt lost through sweating through a normal diet. The best treatment for heat rash is to stay in a cool and dry environment. It is good to keep heat rash areas dry using powder, etc. After sweating a lot, do not drink too much water at once. Since sweating can also deplete the body of electrolytes and minerals, it is good to replenish them with ion drinks (sports drinks). Consult with a doctor before consuming sports drinks or supplementing with salts if you have chronic diseases such as diabetes or hypertension. The elderly may find it difficult to adapt to sudden temperature changes, and the medications they take may influence their body's ability to regulate body temperature or sweating, requiring extra care. Stay in cool places and drink more water than usual. If the doctor limits the amount of water you can drink, ask how much water you should drink on hot days. Take a shower or bath to cool off, do not engage in too intense activity, and take sufficient rest. Avoid using hot fires for cooking to ensure that the house does not get hot. Do not leave children in parked cars.
