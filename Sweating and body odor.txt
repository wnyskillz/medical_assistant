Sweating and body odor are common when you exercise or you're too warm. They're also common when you're feeling nervous, anxious or stressed.Unusual changes in sweating — either too much (hyperhidrosis) or too little (anhidrosis) — can be cause for concern. Changes in body odor also may signal a health problem.Otherwise, lifestyle and home treatments can usually help with normal sweating and body odor.Some people naturally sweat more or less than other people. Body odor also can vary from person to person. See a doctor if:Sweating and body odor are caused by sweat glands in your body. The two main types of sweat glands are eccrine glands and apocrine glands. Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of the skin. When your body temperature rises, these glands release fluids that cool your body as they evaporate.Apocrine glands are found in areas where you have hair, such as your armpits and groin. These glands release a milky fluid when you're stressed. This fluid is odorless until it combines with bacteria on your skin.Oct 27, 2021CON-XXXXXXXXMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
