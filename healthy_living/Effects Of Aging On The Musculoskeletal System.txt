From about age 30 the density of bones begins to diminish in men and women . This loss of bone density accelerates in women aftermenopause. As a result bones become more fragile and are more likely to break seeOsteoporosisespecially in old age .As people age their joints are affected by changes in cartilage and in connective tissue . The cartilage inside a joint becomes thinner and components of the cartilage the proteoglycans substances that help provide the cartilage s resilience become altered which may make the joint less resilient and more susceptible to damage . Thus in some people the surfaces of the joint do not slide as well over each other as they used to . This process may lead toosteoarthritis.Additionally joints become stiffer because the connective tissue within ligaments and tendons becomes more rigid and brittle . This change also limits the range of motion of joints .Loss of muscle sarcopenia is a process that starts around age 30 and progresses throughout life . In this process the amount of muscle tissue and the number and size of muscle fibers gradually decrease . The result of sarcopenia is a gradual loss of muscle mass and muscle strength . This mild loss of muscle strength places increased stress on certain joints such as the knees and may predispose a person to arthritis or falling . Fortunately the loss in muscle mass and strength can partially be overcome or at least significantly delayed by a program of regular exercise .The types of muscle fibers are affected by aging as well . The numbers of muscle fibers that contract faster decrease much more than the numbers of muscle fibers that contract slower . Thus muscles are not able to contract as quickly in old age .
