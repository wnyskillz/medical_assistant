Originating in China several millennia ago traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that illness results from the imbalance of the life force qi pronounced chee through the body . Qi is restored by balancing the opposing forces of yin dark feminine negative forces and yang bright masculine positive forces which manifest in the body as cold and heat internal and external and deficiency and excess . Various practices are used to preserve and restore qi and thus health .Most commonly used areAcupunctureMedicinal herbsQi gongOther practices include diet andmassage.Traditional Chinese medicine uses formulas containing mixtures of herbs to treat various ailments . Determining whether these mixtures are safe and effective is difficult . One problem is that standardization and quality control are almost nonexistent . Thus the following can resultProportions of herbs in the same mixture may vary .The amount of the active ingredient can vary from one source for herbs to another .Mixtures may contain various other substances such as substances produced by pharmaceutical companies or may be contaminated with toxic heavy metals .Because mixtures can vary so much and because there are so many mixtures that could be studied most conventional research usually studies one herb not a mixture . However one herb used alone rather than as a part of a mixture may not be considered effective by traditional health care professionals .See alsoOverview of Integrative Complementary and Alternative Medicine.Medicinal Uses of Traditional Chinese MedicineChinese herbal mixtures have been used to treatirritable bowel syndromeTourette syndromeand many other disorders . For the most part evidence that these mixtures are effective is weak or inconclusive although conclusive evidence is difficult to obtain because of the variability of the types and compositions of the herbs used . For example some evidence suggests that the herbAstragalusmay improve quality of life for people being treated with chemotherapy for lung cancer . However it does not prolong life or slow the progression of cancer . In such cases more research is needed to determine whether the herbs are effective .Possible Side Effects of Traditional Chinese MedicineEach herb and mixture may have its own unique side effects . For example an herb called ma huangEphedraan ingredient in many remedies is a stimulant that can increase heart rate and blood pressure and thus increase the risk of stroke or heart attack .In herbal mixtures adverse effects may also result from interactions between active ingredients .More InformationThe following English language resource may be useful .
