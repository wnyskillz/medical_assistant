Ideally a couple who is thinking of having a baby should see a doctor or other health care practitioner to discuss whether pregnancy is advisable . Usually pregnancy is very safe . However some disorders can become severe during pregnancy . Also for some couples the risk of having a baby with a hereditary disorder is increased .As soon as a couple is thinking of having a baby the woman should start taking a multivitamin that containsfolateneural tube defect. Women who have had a baby with a neural tube defect should start taking a much larger amount than usually recommended 4 000 micrograms as soon as they start thinking of having another baby . Doses of 1 000 micrograms or higher are available only with a prescription .Did You Know . . .Women who are thinking of becoming pregnant should start taking a multivitamin that contains folate which helps prevent certain birth defects rather than waiting until they are pregnant .If the couple decides to try to have a baby they and the doctor discuss ways to make the pregnancy as healthy as possible . The woman should ask the doctor about factors that could impair her health or the health of the developing fetus .Factors or situations to avoidinclude the followingUsing tobacco or alcoholBeing exposed to secondhand smoke which may harm the fetusHaving contact with cat litter or cat feces unless the cats are strictly confined to the home and are not exposed to other cats such contact can transmittoxoplasmosisan infection by a protozoan that can damage the fetus s brainBeing exposed to hot temperatures for a long timeBeing exposed to chemicals or paint fumesHaving contact with people who haverubellaGerman measles or other infections that can cause birth defectsHaving contact with people who havechickenpoxorshinglesunless the woman has had a test that shows she has had chickenpox and is immune to itChickenpox and shingles are caused by herpes viruses . During delivery these viruses can be spread to the fetus and cause severe illness . The virus can also cause pneumonia which is occasionally severe in the woman .Knowing about and dealing with such factors before pregnancy may help reduce the risk of problems during pregnancy seeHigh Risk Pregnancy. In addition the woman can discuss her diet and her social emotional and medical concerns with the doctor .When a woman sees a doctor or another health care practitioner before she is pregnant she can be given any needed vaccines such as therubella vaccine. If she is not already taking folate doctors can prescribe prenatal multivitamins that contain the recommended daily amount RDA of folate or a larger amount of folate if the woman has had a baby with a neural tube defect . If neededgenetic screeningcan be done to determine whether the woman and her partner are at increased risk of having a baby with a hereditary genetic disorder .After pregnancy is confirmed the woman should have a physical examination preferably between 6 and 8 weeks of pregnancy . At this time the length of the pregnancy can be estimated and the date of delivery can be predicted as accurately as possible .Doctors ask about disorders the woman has and has had drugs she taken and details about previous pregnancies including problems that occurred such asdiabetesmiscarriagesandbirth defects. Many doctors routinely ask women aboutdomestic violencewhether she is being mentally physically or sexually abused by someone she lives with .The first physical examination during pregnancy is very thorough . It includes the followingMeasurement of weight height and blood pressureExamination of the ankles for swellingPelvic examinationDuring this examination the doctor notes the size and position of the uterus .Blood tests A sample of blood is taken and analyzed . Analysis includes a complete blood cell count tests for infectious diseases such as syphilis hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus HIV and tests for evidence of immunity to rubella and chickenpox varicella . Blood type including Rh factor status positive or negative is determined .Urine tests A sample of urine is taken and analyzed .Papanicolaou Pap testor a variation of it Samples of tissue from the cervix are taken to check for cancer of the cervix .Test for sexually transmitted infectionsImmediately after the Pap test another sample of tissue from the cervix is taken to test for sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydial infection .Other tests may be done depending on the woman s situation . Thyroid hormone levels may be measured in some women such as those with who have had a thyroid disorder diabetes infertility or miscarriage .If the woman has Rh negative blood it is tested for antibodies to the Rh factor seeRh Incompatibility. The woman s immune system produces these antibodies when her Rh negative blood comes in contact with Rh positive blood for example in a previous pregnancy with a fetus who has Rh positive blood . The antibodies called Rh antibodies may destroy blood cells in a fetus with Rh positive blood causing severe problems even death for the fetus . If antibodies in a pregnant woman s blood are detected early the doctor can take measures to protect the fetus . All women with Rh negative blood are given Rh D immune globulin injected into a muscle at 28 weeks of pregnancy . They are also given an injection after any possible contact between their blood and the fetus s blood for example after an episode of vaginal bleeding or amniocentesis and after delivery . Rh D immune globulin reduces the risk that the fetus s blood cells will be destroyed .Did You Know . . .Things to avoid during pregnancy include tobacco second hand smoke drugs alcohol cat litter and feces and contact with people who may have chickenpox or shingles .During the flu season all pregnant women should get a flu shot .Women of African descent are tested forsickle cell trait or diseaseif they have not been tested previously .

The woman s ankles are examined for swelling .Doctors check the heartbeat of the fetus . It can usually be detected at about 10 to 11 weeks with a handheldDoppler ultrasounddevice . Once a heartbeat has been detected doctors check it at each visit to determine whether it is normal .At each visit urine is tested for sugar . Sugar in the urine may indicate diabetes . If the urine contains sugar a blood test to check for diabetes is done as soon as possible . Even if the urine does not contain sugar doctors usually test all women for the type of diabetes that develops during pregnancygestational diabetes. This blood test is done at 24 to 28 weeks . It measures the level of sugar glucose in the blood 1 hour after women drink a liquid that contains a certain amount of glucose called a glucose tolerance test . If women have risk factors for gestational diabetes this test is done early in the pregnancy preferably before 12 weeks .Risk factors for gestational diabetes include the followingSevere overweight weighing more than 250 poundsGestational diabetes or a large baby weighing 10 pounds or more in a previous pregnancyAn unexplained miscarriage in a previous pregnancyFirst degree relatives such as mothers or sisters with diabetesA history of having sugar in the urine over a long period of timePolycystic ovary syndromewithinsulinresistanceIf results of the initial test are normal these at risk women are retested at 24 to 28 weeks .At each visit the urine is also tested for protein . Protein in urine may indicatepreeclampsiaa type of high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy .Blood tests to check for thyroid disorders is done if womenHave symptoms of a thyroid disorderCome from an area where moderate to severe iodine insufficiency occursHave relatives who have had a thyroid disorderHave had a thyroid disorderHave type 1 diabetesHave had infertility problems early delivery of a baby or a miscarriageHave had head or neck radiation therapyAre severely obeseAre over 30 years oldIf women have a high risk of conceiving a baby with a genetic disorderprenatal diagnostic testingcan be done .Most doctors believe thatultrasonographythe safest imaging procedure should be done at least once during a pregnancy to make sure the fetus is normally formed and to verify the expected date of delivery . It is usually done between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy .For the procedure a device that produces sound waves transducer is placed on the woman s abdomen . The sound waves are processed to form an image that is displayed on a monitor . Sometimes particularly during early pregnancy the doctor uses an ultrasound device that can be inserted in the vagina . Ultrasonography produces high quality images including live action images that show the fetus in motion . These images provide the doctor with useful information and can reassure a pregnant woman .Ultrasonography can also be used to do the followingShow the fetus s beating heart and thus confirm that the fetus is alive as early as 5 weeks of pregnancyIdentify the sex of the fetus as early as 14 weeks of pregnancySee whether a woman is carrying more than one fetusIdentify abnormalities such as a mislocated placentaplacenta previatoo much fluid in the sac that contains the fetuspolyhydramniosor anabnormal position of the fetusDate the pregnancy and thus help determine whether the pregnancy is progressing normallyIdentify birth defects sometimesCheck for evidence ofDown syndromeand some other disorders by measuring the fluid filled space near the back of the fetus s neck called nuchal translucencyGuide the placement of instruments during certain procedures such as prenatal diagnostic testingToward the end of pregnancy ultrasonography may be used to identify premature rupture of the fluid filled membranes containing the fetus . Ultrasonography can provide information that helps doctors decide whether cesarean delivery is needed .X rays are not routinely taken during pregnancy but they can be taken safely when necessary . If an x ray is required the fetus is shielded by placing a lead filled garment over the woman s lower abdomen to cover the uterus .Experts recommend that all pregnant women be vaccinated against theinfluenzavirus during the influenza flu season .Pregnant women can be given thehepatitis B vaccineif needed .Experts recommend a booster shot for tetanus diphtheria and pertussisTdapafter 20 weeks of pregnancy preferably at 27 to 36 weeks or after delivery even if the shots are up to date .Although theCOVID 19 vaccinehas not been specifically evaluated in pregnant women experts recommend that the COVID 19 vaccine can be given to pregnant women who are eligible for vaccination and who have no contraindications to the vaccine such as allergy to a component of the vaccine . No vaccines have been fully approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration FDA but some have been authorized for emergency use .
