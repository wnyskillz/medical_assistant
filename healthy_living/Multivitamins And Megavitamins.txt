But the risk of getting too much of certain vitamins and minerals is also higher in multivitamin users .Studies have also shown that multivitamin users tend to have healthier lifestyles and diets than people who do not take these supplements . For this reason it is difficult to tell whether the prevention of chronic diseases and the promotion of good health in multivitamin users is due to their use of these supplements or because they tend to have healthier diets and lifestyles .Several large studies have found no clear evidence that vitamin supplements can prevent chronic diseases or death due to major chronic diseases in people who do not have any nutritional deficiencies .Side Effects of Multivitamins and MegavitaminsTaking multivitamins that provide nutrients in amounts that are similar to recommended daily intakes should be safe for most healthy people .

But supplements such as megavitamins containing larger amounts than those recommended can have unwanted effects and can even be harmful .
