Infertility is a disease defined by the inability to achieve a pregnancy and or the need for medical intervention to achieve a successful pregnancy .Infertility is defined as disease by theand theASRM . Women under 35 years old without any known cause for infertility in her or her partner should be evaluated by a doctor after having regular unprotected sexual intercourse for 12 months . Women 35 years or older should be evaluated after 6 months .Frequent intercourse without birth control usually results in pregnancyFor 70 of couples within 3 monthsFor 80 within 6 monthsFor 90 within 1 yearTo maximize the chance of pregnancy couples should have frequent intercourse in the 6 days and particularly in the 3 days before the ovaries release an egg ovulation . Ovulation usually occurs in the middle of themenstrual cyclewhich is about 14 days before the first day of a women s next menstrual period .Two of the more common methods women can use to estimate when ovulation occurs areHome ovulation prediction kits probably the best wayMeasurement of body temperature at rest basal body temperatureHome ovulation prediction kits are the most accurate method that can be used at home but they are not 100 accurate so some ovulations may be missed . These kits are used to detect an increase in luteinizing hormone in the urine . Luteinizing hormone stimulates the ovaries to trigger ovulation . Usually this increase occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation . Women usually need to repeat the test for several consecutive days so kits typically include five to seven sticks . The sticks can be held under a stream of urine or dipped into urine that is collected in a clean container .Basal body temperature measurement is another option . If women have regular periods measuring their temperature each day before they get out of bed can help estimate when ovulation is occurring . A decrease suggests that ovulation is about to occur . An increase of 0 . 9 F 0 . 5 C or more suggests ovulation has just occurred . However this method is time consuming and is not reliable or precise . At best it predicts ovulation within 2 days after the fact .Estimating when ovulation occurs thereby estimating when the best time for intercourse is may be particularly helpful for couples who do not have intercourse regularly .Causes of InfertilityThe cause of infertility may be due to problems in the male partner the female partner or both . The cause may be a disease or other issue with a person s reproductive function such as problems withSperm20 to 35 of couplesOvulation20 to 25Number of healthy eggs in the ovariesincreases with ageEndometriosis up to 40Fallopian tubesup to 65Abnormalities of the uterus such at uterine fibroids or other pelvic abnormalities 2 or moreCervical mucusabout 3Unidentified factors15 to 25Most studies have reported that men over 45 years old are less fertile than younger men .Diagnosis of InfertilityA doctor s evaluationVarious tests depending on the suspected causeThe diagnosis of infertility requires a thorough assessment of both partners . Usually the assessment is done after at least 1 year of trying to achieve a pregnancy . However it is done sooner ifA woman is over age 35 usually after 6 months of trying to become pregnant .A woman s menstrual periods occur infrequently .A woman has a previously identified abnormality of the uterus fallopian tubes or ovaries including for example having only 1 ovary .Doctors have identified or suspect problems with sperm in a man .Tests are usually done for both prospective parents to figure out the cause . Tests may includeBlood tests To measure the hormones involved in the release of eggs ovulation by the ovaries such as follicle stimulating hormoneUltrasonography or other imaging tests To check for abnormalities of the uterus or fallopian tubesSemen analysis To check for sperm disordersTreatment of InfertilityTreatment of the causeSometimes medicationsSometimes assisted reproductive technologiesMaking changes to remove or decrease the effect of risk factors such as smoking cessationEven when no specific cause of infertility can be identified prospective parents may still benefit from treatment . In such cases women may be given medications that stimulate several eggs to mature and be releasedfertility medicationsproblems with ovulation.Alternatively doctors may useassisted reproductive technologiesor other procedures such as the followingIntrauterine inseminationinvolves selecting only the most active sperm which are then placed directly in the uterus .In vitro fertilizationIVF involves stimulating the ovaries retrieving the mature eggs fertilizing them with sperm in culture dishes in vitro growing the embryos in the culture and implanting 1 or more embryos in a woman s uterus .Fertility medications and assisted reproductive technologies may result in a multiple gestation such as twins or triplets .People with infertility may also make changes to minimize certain risk factors . For example smoking cessation for people who smoke weight loss for patients who are overweight no or moderate consumption of alcohol and consumption of a balanced diet with vitamins if needed are recommended .While a couple is being treated for infertility 1 or both partners may experience frustration emotional stress feelings of inadequacy and guilt . They may alternate between hope and despair . Feeling isolated and unable to communicate they may become angry at or resentful toward each other family members friends or the doctor . The emotional stress can lead to fatigue anxiety sleep or eating disturbances and an inability to concentrate . In addition the financial burden and time commitment involved in diagnosis and treatment can cause relationship stress .Managing the stress of infertility treatment can be improved if both partners are involved in the process and receive information about the treatment process including how long it takes . Knowing what to expect and the chances of success can help prospective parents cope with the stress .Some questions to ask before or during treatment includeWhen to end treatmentWhen to seek a second opinionWhen to consider adoptionFor example if pregnancy has not occurred after 3 years of attempting it or after 2 years of being treated for infertility the chance of pregnancy is very low .Counseling and psychological support including support groups such as RESOLVE and Family Equality can help .More InformationThe following English language resources may be useful .
