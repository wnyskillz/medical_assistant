Doctors usually use the following specific established criteriaAnxiety is very distressing .Anxiety interferes with functioning .Anxiety is long lasting or keeps coming back .Doctors look for other disorders that may be causing anxiety such asdepressionor asleep disturbance. Doctors also ask whether relatives have had similar symptoms because anxiety disorders tend to run in families .Doctors also do a physical examination .

Not only might they be embarrassed to admit this to their doctor but they may also be unwilling to give up these substances until their doctor comes up with a viable alternative . Self medicating in this way is dangerous and can lead to a vicious circle of rebounding anxiety after use followed by an urgent need to self medicate again and again .If an anxiety disorder is diagnosed medications orpsychotherapysuch asbehavioral therapyalone or in combination can significantly relieve the distress and dysfunction for most people . Different types of psychotherapies may be used such as cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulness based stress reduction hypnosis and supportive psychotherapy .antidepressantssuch as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs work as well for anxiety disorders as they do for depression .All anxiety disorders can occur along with other mental health conditions .

Treating the alcohol use disorder without treating the anxiety is unlikely to be effective since the person may be using alcohol to decrease the anxiety . On the other hand treating the anxiety without addressing the alcohol disorder may be unsuccessful because daily changes in the amount of alcohol in the blood can cause levels of anxiety to fluctuate .More InformationThe following English language resource may be useful .
