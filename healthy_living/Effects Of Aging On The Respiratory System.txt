The effects of aging on the respiratory system are similar to those that occur in other organs maximum function gradually declines . Age related changes in the lungs includeDecreases in peak airflow how quickly someone can exhale andexchange of carbon dioxide and oxygenDecreases in measures oflung functionsuch as vital capacity the maximum amount of air that can be breathed out following a maximum inhalationWeakening of therespiratory musclesDecline in the effectiveness oflung defense mechanismsSee alsoOverview of the Respiratory System.In healthy people these age related changes seldom lead to symptoms . These changes contribute somewhat to an older person s reduced ability to do vigorous exercise especially intense aerobic exercise such as running biking and mountain climbing . However age related decreases in heart function may be a more important cause of such limitations .Older people are at higher risk of developingpneumoniaafter bacterial or viral infections . Thus vaccines for respiratory infections such asinfluenzaandpneumococcal pneumoniaare particularly important for older people .Importantly age related changes in the lungs are compounded by the effects of heart and lung diseases especially those caused by the destructive effects of smoking .Did You KnowIn healthy people age related reductions in lung function seldom lead to symptoms but they can contribute to an older person s reduced ability to do vigorous exercise .
