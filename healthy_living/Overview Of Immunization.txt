Immunization vaccination helps the body defend itself against diseases caused by certain bacteria or viruses .Immunity the ability of the body to defend itself against diseases caused by certain bacteria or viruses may occur naturally when people are exposed to bacteria or viruses or doctors may provide it through vaccination . When people are vaccinated against a disease they usually do not get the disease or get only a mild form of the disease . However because no vaccine is 100 effective some people who have been vaccinated still may get the disease .Vaccines have been very effective in preventing serious disease and in improving health worldwide . In communities and countries where vaccines are widely used many diseases that were once common and or fatal such aspolioanddiphtheriaare now rare or under control . One diseasesmallpoxhas been completely eliminated by vaccination .However effective vaccines are not yet available for many important infections including most sexually transmitted infections such asHIV infectionsyphilisgonorrheaandchlamydiainfections caused by ticks such asLyme diseaseand many tropical diseases such asChagas disease.As of October 2023 the World Health Organization WHO recommends widespread use of the RTS S AS01 RTS S and R21 Matrix Mmalariavaccine among children in malaria endemic areas with moderate to highPlasmodium falciparummalaria transmission . Malaria vaccination is an important intervention to prevent malaria which causes hundreds of thousands of deaths each year mostly in children in Africa . See.It is important to follow recommendations for vaccination . This is very important for a person s own health and for the health of their family and people in their community . Many of the diseases prevented by vaccination are easily spread from person to person . Many of them are still present in the United States and remain common in other parts of the world . These diseases can spread rapidly among unvaccinated children who because of the ease of modern travel can be exposed even if they live in areas where a disease is not common .Vaccines available today are highly effective and side effects are rare .Types of ImmunizationThere are 2 types of immunizationActive immunizationPassive immunizationIn active immunization vaccines are used to stimulate the body s natural defense mechanisms theimmune system. Vaccines are preparations that contain one of the followingNoninfectious fragments of bacteria or virusesA usually harmful substance toxin that is produced by a bacteria but has been modified to be harmless called a toxoidWeakened attenuated live whole organisms that do not cause illnessThe body s immune system responds to a vaccine by producing substances such asantibodiesthat recognize and attack the specific bacteria or virus contained in the vaccine . Then whenever the person is exposed to that specific bacteria or virus the body automatically produces these antibodies and other substances to prevent or lessen illness . The process of giving a vaccine is called vaccination although many doctors use the more general termimmunization.Vaccines that containlive but weakened organismsincludeBacille CalmetteBCG for tuberculosisChickenpoxvaricellaChikungunyaCholeracertain vaccines given by mouthEbolaInfluenzaonly the nasal spray vaccineMeasles mumps rubellaPolioonly the oral vaccine which is no longer used in the United StatesRotavirusSmallpoxTyphoidonly the oral vaccineYellow feverDid You Know . . .Vaccines work by stimulating the body s natural defense mechanisms theimmune system.In passive immunization antibodies against a specific infectious organism or the toxin produced by an organism are given directly to a person . These antibodies are obtained from several sourcesThe blood serum of animals usually horses that have been exposed to a particular organism or toxin and have developed immunityBlood collected from a large group of people called pooled humanimmune globulinPeople known to have antibodies to a particular disease that is people who have been immunized or who are recovering from the disease called hyperimmune globulin because these people have higher levels of antibodies in their bloodAntibody producing cells usually taken from mice grown in a laboratoryPassive immunization is used for people whose immune system does not respond adequately to an infection or for people who acquire an infection before they can be vaccinated for example after being bitten by an animal withrabies.Passive immunization can also be used to prevent disease when people are likely to be exposed and do not have time to get or complete a vaccination series . For example a solution containing gamma globulin that is active againstchickenpox viruscan be given to a pregnant woman who does not have immunity to the virus and has been exposed to it . The chickenpox virus can harm the fetus and cause serious complications such as pneumonia in the woman .Passive immunization lasts for only a few weeks until the body eliminates the injected antibodies .Vaccine AdministrationVaccines and antibodies are usually given by injection into a muscle intramuscularly or under the skin subcutaneously . Antibodies are sometimes injected into a vein intravenously . One type of influenza vaccine is sprayed into the nose .More than one vaccine may be given at a time in one combination vaccine or in separate injections at different injection sites .Some vaccines are given routinely that is given to most people on a recommended schedule for example theis given to adults preferably every 10 years see. Some vaccines areroutinely given to childrensee also.Other vaccines are usually given mainly to specific groups of people . For example theyellow fever vaccineis given only to people traveling to certain parts of Africa and South America . Still other vaccines are given after possible exposure to a specific disease . For example therabies vaccinemay be given to a person who has been bitten by a dog or other animal if the animal may be infected with rabies .Vaccination Restrictions and PrecautionsFor many vaccines the only reason for not being vaccinated isA history of a serious life threatening allergic reaction such as ananaphylactic reactionto the vaccine or to one of its componentsEgg allergyis common in the United States . Some vaccines including mostinfluenza vaccinescontain trace amounts of egg antigens . According to the CDC people with a history of egg allergy should receive the influenza vaccine regardless of the severity of any previous reaction to egg . See. People should receive all vaccines including the influenza vaccine from health care professionals who have access to the proper equipment needed to recognize and treat aserious allergic reaction.Vaccines that contain live organismsshould not be used or should be delayed in people with certain conditions such asUse ofmedications that suppress the immune systemimmunosuppressants such as corticosteroids and chemotherapy agentsAdisorder that weakens the immune systemsuch as HIVPregnancyDevelopment ofGuillain syndromewithin 6 weeks of a previous dose of the vaccineIn some cases to prevent spreading infection to people with a weakened immune system people who live with them should also not be given vaccines that contain live organisms .If people stop taking the medications that suppress their immune system or if their weakened immune system recovers sufficiently receiving vaccines that contain live virus may be safe .Common Vaccinations in ChildrenChildren in the United States typically are given a number of vaccines according to a standard schedule see. If vaccines are missed most can be given later according to a catch up schedule .Common Vaccinations in AdultsAdults may also be advised to receive certain vaccines see also. When advising adults about vaccination a doctor considers the person s age health history childhood vaccinations occupation geographic location travel plans and other factors .Despite clinical guidelines and the burden and consequences of vaccine preventable diseases some adults do not receive the recommended vaccines . In the United States vaccination coverage the percentage of people who have received specific vaccines among adults remains low for most vaccines . In addition coverage for all vaccines differs by race and ethnicity with generally lower coverage among Black and Hispanic adults compared with White adults see.Vaccine SafetyIn the United States the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC monitors the safety of vaccines . Doctors must report certain problems that occur after routine vaccination to the CDC s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systemand Vaccine Safety Datalink. If any health problem happens after vaccination anyone doctors nurses or any member of the general public can submit a report to VAERS . VAERS reports cannot determine whether a health problem was caused by the vaccine .Vaccines usually cause no problems although mild side effects such as soreness or redness at the injection site may occur . Sometimes parents are concerned about thesafety of childhood vaccines.One of parents main concerns has been that certain vaccines such as themeasles mumps rubella MMR vaccineor vaccines that contain thimerosal a mercury based preservative may increase the risk ofautism.Many different groups of scientists have studied these concerns and have completely disproved the supposed relationship between vaccines and autism seeChildhood Vaccination Concernsin THE MANUAL andat the CDC web site .Nevertheless most manufacturers have developed thimerosal free vaccines for use in infants and adults . Information about vaccines that currently contain low levels of thimerosal is available at the Food and Drug Administration s web site.Vaccination Before Foreign TravelResidents of the United States may be required to receive specific vaccines before traveling to areas that have infectious diseases not normally found in the United States see tableVaccines for International Travel. Recommendations change frequently in response to disease outbreaks .The CDC provides the most up to date information on vaccination requirements in theirsection .
