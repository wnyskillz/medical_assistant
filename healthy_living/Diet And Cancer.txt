Many studies have tried to determine whether specific foods increase or decrease a person s risk of getting cancer . Unfortunately different studies have had conflicting results so it is hard to know what effect foods ordietary supplementshave on cancer risk . A common problem is that when studies find that people who eat more of a certain food seem to have lower rates of a certain cancer it can be difficult to tell whether those people also were different in terms of other risk factors such as where they live how much they smoke and drink and so forth .Often when doctors do a controlled trial and randomly give some people a seemingly helpful food or supplement the studies do not show a beneficial effect . Some foods and supplements have been studied more than others and many studies are ongoing . The most convincing evidence is from studies that show diets low in fiber and high in processed meats increase cancer risk . Obesity regardless of the type of diet increases the risk of many cancers .Alcohol increases the risk of cancers of the mouth throat esophagus liver breast and the colon and rectum . People who smoke as well as drink have a much higher risk of these cancers .Antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and beta carotenevitamin AAlthough some early studies show an increased risk of bladder cancer brain cancer and lymphomas with certain sweeteners these studies were done in animals . No studies in humans show an increased risk of cancer with the use of these sweeteners .Genes from different plants or from certain microorganisms are added to the genes of some plants to increase the plants hardiness or resistance to pests or to improve them in some other way . No current evidence demonstrates that bioengineered foods have any effect on cancer risk .Although some older studies appeared to show a link between coffee consumption and cancer risk more recent studies have not shown any connection .Some studies report that a diet high in fiber reduces the risk of cancer especially colorectal cancer but these reports controversial .Some studies in animals suggest that omega 3 fatty acids may stop cancers from growing or slow their growth . However these findings have not been replicated in humans .Studies have not shown an increased risk of cancer in people who drink fluoridated water or who use toothpastes or undergo dental fluoride treatments .Food additives must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration before they are included in foods so new additives undergo extensive testing . So far no evidence shows that the levels of additives found in food products increase the risk of cancer .Radiation of food which is sometimes used to kill microorganisms in food does not increase cancer risk .Some studies suggest that lycopene a natural red pigment and antioxidant found mainly in tomatoes may reduce the risk of some cancers but these data are controversial .Eating meat cooked at high temperatures for example by grilling or broiling may introduce cancer causing chemicals and increase cancer risk .There is no evidence that organically grown foods reduce cancer risk more than the same foods grown by other methods .Obese people have higher risks of diverse cancers .There is no evidence that pesticide residue found in small amounts on foods increases the risk of cancer .People who eat large amounts of processed meats may be at risk for stomach and colon and rectal cancers . Some evidence suggests that this is caused by nitrates in luncheon meats hams and hot dogs .Some studies have found higher rates of some types of cancers in countries where fat intake is higher . However no studies have found that decreasing fat intake decreases the risk of cancer . Of more importance however is that foods that contain high levels of saturated fats also contain many calories and may contribute to obesity which is a risk factor for cancer and other health problems .There is no convincing evidence thatseleniumreduces cancer risk .There is no convincing evidence that spices such as tumericcapsaicinred pepper cumin or curry decrease cancer risk .More informationThe following English language resources may be useful .
