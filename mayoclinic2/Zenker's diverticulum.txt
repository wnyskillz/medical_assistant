The condition is not common. Connected bands of muscle that work to pass food from the mouth to the stomach make up the esophagus.Over time, the bulge of Zenker's diverticulum can get bigger. Food, pills and even thick mucus can get stuck in the pouch instead of going through the esophagus. This can lead to problems with eating and other complications.The cause of Zenker's diverticulum is not known. It happens most often to men older than 60.

If that doesn't happen, food can get trapped in the esophagus.If the muscle in the area where the food gets trapped is weak, the food can cause the esophagus to bulge and form a pouch.Risk factors for Zenker's diverticulum include:Complications can happen if Zenker's diverticulum isn't treated.
