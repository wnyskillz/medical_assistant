Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition that can occur when small blood vessels become damaged and inflamed. This damage can cause clots to form in the vessels all through the body. The clots can damage the kidneys and other organs. Hemolytic uremic syndrome can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening.Anyone can get hemolytic uremic syndrome. But it's most common in young children. Most often, infection with certain strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria is the cause.Other infections, certain medicines or conditions such as pregnancy, cancer or autoimmune diseases can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome. It also can be the result of certain gene changes.Hemolytic uremic syndrome is serious. But treating it in time leads to a full recovery for most people, especially young children.The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include:All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia.

These strains are called Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC).Most of the hundreds of types of E. coli are typical and harmless. But some strains of E. coli can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome.Other causes of hemolytic uremic syndrome can include:An uncommon type of hemolytic uremic syndrome, called atypical, can be passed down through families. People who inherit the gene that causes this form of hemolytic uremic syndrome don't always get the condition. But an infection, the use of certain medicines or ongoing health conditions can start hemolytic uremic syndrome in people with the gene.Hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E.coli can occur if you:The risk of getting hemolytic uremic syndrome is highest for:Hemolytic uremic syndrome can cause life-threatening complications, including:Meat or produce that has E. coli won't always look, feel or smell bad.
