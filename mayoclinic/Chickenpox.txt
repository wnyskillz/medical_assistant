It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated.Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare.Chickenpox is often a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including:In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death.People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include:Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies.

The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems.The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. This is called postherpetic neuralgia.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax.Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles.The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox.

It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. This is also called the MMRV vaccine.In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children.For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines.Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. The doses should be given at least three months apart.People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age.If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out.Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States.
