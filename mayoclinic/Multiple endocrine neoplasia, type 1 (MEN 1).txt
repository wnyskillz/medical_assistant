Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), sometimes called Wermer's syndrome, is a rare disorder that causes tumors in the endocrine glands and parts of the small intestine and stomach. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroids, pancreas and pituitary — grow tumors and release excessive amounts of hormones that can lead to disease. However, the tumors are usually noncancerous (benign).The excess hormones can cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms. These can include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines. MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect problems, and doctors can provide treatment as needed.MEN 1 is an inherited disorder. That means people who have a genetic change that causes MEN 1 can pass it on to their children. Signs and symptoms of MEN 1 include the following:Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body.MEN 1 is caused by a change in the MEN1 gene. That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin. Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly.Research has found that there are many different changes in the MEN1 gene that can cause the MEN 1 condition to develop. People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children. Many people with a change in the MEN1 gene inherit it from a parent. But some people are the first in their family to have a new MEN1 gene change that doesn't come from a parent.Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) care at Mayo ClinicMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
