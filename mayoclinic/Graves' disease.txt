The thyroid gland sits at the base of the neck.Graves' disease is an immune system condition that affects the thyroid gland. It causes the body to make too much thyroid hormone. That condition is called hyperthyroidism.Thyroid hormones affect many organs in the body. So Graves' disease symptoms also can affect those organs. Anyone can get Graves' disease. But it's more common in women and in people older than 30.Treatment for Graves' disease helps lower the amount of thyroid hormone that the body makes and eases symptoms.An enlarged thyroid can cause a bulge in the neck.Common symptoms of Graves' disease include:Thyroid eye disease symptoms include bulging eyes and redness. The eyelids may not cover the eyeball all the way. This eye condition also is called Graves' ophthalmopathy.Thyroid eye disease also is called Graves' ophthalmopathy. About 25% of people with Graves' disease have eye symptoms. Thyroid eye disease affects muscles and other tissues around the eyes. Symptoms may include:Rarely, people who have Graves' disease have skin that darkens and thickens. The skin has a texture like an orange peel. This is called Graves' dermopathy. It comes from a buildup of protein in the skin. It often appears on the shins and on the tops of the feet.Rarely, people with Graves' disease have darkening and thickening of the skin. It most often appears on the shins or the tops of the feet. The skin has a texture like an orange peel.This is called Graves' dermopathy. It comes from a buildup of protein in the skin.

Experts don't know why this happens.The immune system makes antibodies that target viruses, bacteria or other foreign substances. In Graves' disease, the immune system makes an antibody to one part of the cells in the hormone-making gland in the neck, called the thyroid gland.A tiny gland at the base of the brain, called the pituitary gland, makes a hormone that controls the thyroid gland. The antibody linked with Graves' disease is called thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb). TRAb takes over the work of the pituitary hormone. That leads to more thyroid hormone in the body than the body needs. That condition is called hyperthyroidism.Thyroid eye disease, also called Graves' ophthalmopathy, comes from a buildup of certain carbohydrates in the muscles and tissues behind the eyes. The cause isn't known. It may involve the same antibody that can cause the thyroid gland to not work correctly.Thyroid eye disease often appears at the same time as hyperthyroidism or several months later. But symptoms of thyroid eye disease can appear years before or after hyperthyroidism starts. It's also possible to have thyroid eye disease without hyperthyroidism.Factors that can increase the risk of Graves' disease include:Complications of Graves' disease can include:Thyroid storm. This rare but deadly complication of Graves' disease also is called accelerated hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxic crisis. It's more likely to happen when severe hyperthyroidism is not treated or not treated well enough.Thyroid storm happens when a sudden and drastic rise in thyroid hormones causes a number of effects in the body. They include fever, sweating, confusion, delirium, severe weakness, tremors, irregular heartbeat, severe low blood pressure and coma. Thyroid storm needs medical attention right away.Graves' disease care at Mayo ClinicMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
