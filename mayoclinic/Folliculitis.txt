At first it may look like small pimples around the tiny pockets from where each hair grows (hair follicles).The condition can be itchy, sore and embarrassing. The infection can spread and turn into crusty sores.Mild folliculitis will likely heal without scarring in a few days with basic self-care. More-serious or repeat infections may need prescription medicine. Left untreated, severe infections can cause permanent hair loss and scarring.Certain types of folliculitis are known as hot tub rash and barber's itch.Folliculitis signs and symptoms include: Superficial folliculitis can look like a pus-filled bump.
