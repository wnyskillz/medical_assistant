Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that help regulate many functions in the body.An autoimmune disorder is an illness caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. In Hashimoto's disease, immune-system cells lead to the death of the thyroid's hormone-producing cells. The disease usually results in a decline in hormone production (hypothyroidism).Although anyone can develop Hashimoto's disease, it's most common among middle-aged women. The primary treatment is thyroid hormone replacement.Hashimoto's disease is also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis. The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. Hashimoto's disease progresses slowly over the years. You may not notice signs or symptoms of the disease.

The immune system wrongly enlists disease-fighting agents that damage cells and lead to cell death.What causes the immune system to attack thyroid cells is not clear. The onset of disease may be related to:The following factors are associated with an increased risk of Hashimoto's disease:Thyroid hormones are essential for the healthy function of many body systems. Therefore, when Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism are left untreated, many complications can occur. These include:Jan 15, 2022CON-XXXXXXXXMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
