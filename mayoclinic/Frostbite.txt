Frostbite is an injury caused by freezing of the skin and underlying tissues. The early stage of frostbite is called frostnip. It causes a cold feeling followed by numbness. As frostbite gets worse, the affected skin may change color and become hard or waxy-looking.Exposed skin is at risk of frostbite in conditions that are freezing cold and windy or wet. Frostbite also can occur on skin covered by gloves or other clothing.Mild frostbite gets better with rewarming. Seek medical attention for anything more serious than mild frostbite because the condition can cause permanent damage to skin, muscle, bone and other tissue.Skin without cold damage (1) has no change in color or texture. Frostnip (2) is the early stage of frostbite. It causes a slight change in skin color and a cold feeling followed by numbness. Frostnip doesn't injure the skin and can be treated with first aid. With superficial frostbite (3), the skin feels warm. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. With deep frostbite (4), skin changes worsen and large blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Tissue may turn black and hard as it dies.Symptoms of frostbite include:Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, ears, cheeks, penis, chin and tip of the nose.
