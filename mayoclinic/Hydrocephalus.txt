Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain.Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function.Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus.The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age.Common symptoms of hydrocephalus in infants include:Among toddlers and older children, symptoms might include:Common symptoms in this age group include:Among adults 60 and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are:Seek emergency medical care for infants and toddlers with these symptoms:Seek prompt medical attention for other hydrocephalus symptoms in any age group.More than one condition can cause the problems associated with hydrocephalus.

This fluid also fills large open structures, called ventricles, which lie deep inside your brain. The fluid-filled ventricles help keep the brain buoyant and cushioned.Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream.Tissues lining the ventricles of the brain produce cerebrospinal fluid. It flows through the ventricles by way of channels. The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column. It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues on the surface of the brain.Cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in brain function by:Too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles can occur for one of the following reasons:Much of the time, the cause of hydrocephalus is not known. However, developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus.Hydrocephalus may be present at or before birth, known as congenital hydrocephalus. Or it can occur shortly after birth. Any of the following incidents may cause hydrocephalus in newborns:Other factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include:In most cases, hydrocephalus worsens. Without treatment, hydrocephalus leads to complications. Complications may include learning disabilities or developmental and physical disabilities. Complications of this condition also can result in death. When hydrocephalus is mild and it's treated, there may be few, if any, serious complications.Hydrocephalus care at Mayo ClinicMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
