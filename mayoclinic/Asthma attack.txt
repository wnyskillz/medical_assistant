An asthma attack is a sudden worsening of asthma symptoms. Asthma is a long-term condition that makes breathing difficult because airways in the lungs become narrow. Symptoms of asthma attack include coughing, wheezing, tightness in the chest and difficulty getting enough air.These symptoms happen because muscles around airways tighten up, the airways become irritated and swollen, and the lining of the airways produces a fluid called mucus. All of these factors make it difficult to breathe.People who already have a diagnosis of asthma usually have an asthma action plan. This tells them what medicines to take if they have an asthma attack and when to get emergency care. People who do not have a diagnosis or don't have a treatment plan should get emergency care if they have these symptoms.Frequent asthma attacks show that a person's asthma is not under control. A healthcare professional might make changes in medicines and the asthma action plan to improve control.An asthma attack also is called an asthma exacerbation or asthma flare-up.Symptoms of asthma attacks may include:Severe symptoms also may include:The result of an at-home test, called a peak flow meter, can be an important sign of an asthma attack. This device measures how quickly you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are usually a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. This is called your personal best peak flow.An asthma action plan often includes steps to take based on a peak flow reading. A reading below 80% of a best peak flow can be a sign of an asthma attack.An asthma action plan tells you when to call your healthcare professional and when to get emergency care. A plan has three parts with color codes:If you do not have an asthma action plan, get emergency care if quick-relief medicine is not helping symptoms.It's important to keep regular appointments with your healthcare professional. If your asthma is under control, you may be able to take lower doses of medicine. If you are using a rescue inhaler too often to treat asthma attacks, you may need changes to your asthma action plan. These might include taking a new medicine or higher doses of a medicine.Asthma is usually a lifelong disease of inflammation in the lungs caused by an overactive immune system. Inflammation in the lungs includes the tightening of muscles around airways, swelling of tissues in the airways and the release of mucus that can block airways. When this happens, it's difficult to breathe.Asthma attacks occur when something triggers the immune system to take action. Triggers may include:Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack. Factors that can increase the risk include:Asthma attacks affect both a person's health and quality of life. Problems may include:Severe asthma attacks can cause death. Life-threatening asthma attacks are more likely for people who frequently use quick-relief medicines, have had emergency room visits or hospital stays to treat asthma, or have other long-term illnesses.An important step to prevent an allergy attack is to follow your asthma action plan:Your input on how well the plan is working helps your healthcare professional adjust the treatment to prevent asthma attacks.Other steps to prevent asthma attacks include the following:Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
