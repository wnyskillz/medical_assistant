A broken toe is a common injury that's most often caused by dropping something on a foot or stubbing a toe.Usually, treating a broken toe involves taping it to the next toe. But if the fracture is severe — especially if it's in the big toe — proper healing might require a cast or even surgery to heal well.Most broken toes heal well, usually within 4 to 6 weeks. Sometimes, however, a broken toe can get infected. Also, the break might increase the risk of getting osteoarthritis in that toe in the future.Signs and symptoms of a broken toe include:Consult a health care provider if the pain, swelling and change in skin color last for more than a few days or if the injury affects walking or wearing shoes.Dropping something heavy on a foot and stubbing the toe against something hard are the most common causes of a broken toe.Complications may include:Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
