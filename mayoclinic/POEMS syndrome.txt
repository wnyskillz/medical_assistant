These cells produce an abnormal amount of a type of protein, which can damage other parts of the body.POEMS syndrome can be misdiagnosed because the signs and symptoms mimic those of other disorders. POEMS syndrome progresses rapidly without treatment and can become life-threatening, so early diagnosis is important.Treatment for POEMS syndrome might improve your symptoms but doesn't cure the condition. Treatment options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.
