Itching is usually on the hands and feet but also can occur on other parts of the body.Cholestasis of pregnancy can make you very uncomfortable. But more worrisome are the potential complications, especially for your baby.

But there is no rash. Typically, you feel itchy on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet, but you may feel itchy everywhere. The itching is often worse at night and may bother you so much that you can't sleep.The itching is most common during the third trimester of pregnancy but sometimes begins earlier. It may feel worse as your due date gets near.

Cholestasis is reduced or stopped bile flow. Bile is the digestive fluid made in the liver that helps break down fats. Instead of leaving the liver for the small intestine, bile builds up in the liver. As a result, bile acids eventually enter the bloodstream. High levels of bile acids appear to cause the symptoms and complications of cholestasis of pregnancy.Pregnancy hormones, genetics and the environment may all play a role.Some factors that may increase your risk of developing cholestasis of pregnancy include:If you have a history of cholestasis in a prior pregnancy, your risk of developing it during another pregnancy is high. About 60% to 70% of females have it happen again. This is called a recurrence. In severe cases, the risk of recurrence may be as high as 90%.Complications from cholestasis of pregnancy appear to be due to high bile acid levels in the blood. Complications may occur in the mom, but the developing baby is especially at risk.In moms, the condition may temporarily affect the way the body absorbs fat. Poor absorption of fat could result in decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent factors involved with blood clotting. But this complication is rare. Future liver problems may occur but are uncommon.Also, cholestasis of pregnancy increases the risk of complications during pregnancy such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes.In babies, the complications of cholestasis of pregnancy can be severe. They may include:Because complications can be very dangerous for your baby, your pregnancy care provider may consider inducing labor before your due date.There is no known way to prevent cholestasis of pregnancy.Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
