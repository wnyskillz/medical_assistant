The heart on the left shows the typical outer lining of the heart (pericardium). The heart on the right shows a swollen and infected lining (pericarditis).Dressler syndrome is inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis). It's believed to occur as the result of the immune system responding to damage to heart tissue or damage to the sac around the heart (pericardium). The damage can result from a heart attack, surgery or traumatic injury. Symptoms include chest pain, which can feel like chest pain from a heart attack.Dressler syndrome may also be called post-myocardial infarction syndrome, post-traumatic pericarditis, post-cardiac injury syndrome and post-pericardiotomy syndrome.Symptoms are likely to appear weeks to months after a heart attack, surgery or injury to the chest. Symptoms might include:Seek emergency care for sudden or persistent chest pain, which may signal a heart attack or other serious disorder.Experts think Dressler syndrome is caused by the immune system's response to heart damage. The body reacts to the injured tissue by sending immune cells and proteins (antibodies) to clean up and repair the affected area. Sometimes this response causes inflammation in the pericardium.Dressler syndrome may occur after certain heart surgeries or procedures.The immune system reaction that causes Dressler syndrome might also lead to fluid buildup in the tissues surrounding the lungs (pleural effusion).Rarely, Dressler syndrome can cause more-serious complications, including:Some studies suggest that taking the anti-inflammatory medication colchicine (Colcrys, Gloperba, Mitgare) before heart surgery might help prevent Dressler syndrome.Connect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in the Heart & Blood Health support group on Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.346 Replies Sun, Jun 23, 2024 58 Replies Thu, Jun 20, 2024 106 Replies Wed, Jun 19, 2024 Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
