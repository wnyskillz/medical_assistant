In heart valve disease, one or more of the valves in the heart doesn't work properly. There are four heart valves. They keep blood flowing through the heart in the correct direction. Sometimes a valve doesn't open or close all the way. This can change how blood flows through the heart to the rest of the body.Heart valve disease treatment depends on the heart valve affected and the type and severity of the disease. Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace the heart valve.Some people with heart valve disease might not have symptoms for many years. When symptoms occur, they might include:If you have symptoms of possible heart valve disease, make an appointment for a health checkup.

The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves help keep blood flowing in the right direction.Heart valve disease may include a narrowed valve, called valve stenosis. Sometimes, blood moves backward through a valve. This is called valve regurgitation. If the valve flaps bulge backward, the condition is called valve prolapse.To understand the causes of heart valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works.Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. These valves are:Each valve has flaps, called leaflets or cusps. The flaps open and close once during each heartbeat. If a valve flap doesn't open or close properly, less blood moves out of the heart to the rest of the body.Types of heart valve disease include:Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. But adults can get heart valve disease too. Causes of heart valve disease in adults may include infections, age-related changes and other heart conditions.Several things can increase the risk of heart valve disease, including:Heart valve disease can cause many complications, including:Heart valve disease care at Mayo ClinicConnect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in the Heart & Blood Health support group on Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.346 Replies Sun, Jun 23, 2024 58 Replies Thu, Jun 20, 2024 106 Replies Wed, Jun 19, 2024 Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
