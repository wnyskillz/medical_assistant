Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an illness that can lead to bruising and bleeding. Low levels of the cells that help blood clot, also known as platelets, most often cause the bleeding.Once known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, ITP can cause purple bruises. It also can cause tiny reddish-purple dots on the skin that look like a rash.Children can get ITP after a virus. They most often get better without treatment. In adults, the illness often lasts months or years.People with ITP who aren't bleeding and whose platelet count isn't too low might not need treatment. For worse symptoms, treatment might include medicines to raise platelet count or surgery to remove the spleen.Bleeding into the skin looks like tiny reddish-purple spots, also known as petechiae. Petechiae might look like a rash. Here they appear on a leg (A) and on the stomach area (B).Immune thrombocytopenia might not have symptoms.

It attacks and destroys the cells that help blood clot, also known as platelets.In adults, an infection with HIV, hepatitis or the bacteria that causes stomach ulcers, known as H. pylori, can cause ITP. In most children with ITP, the disorder follows a virus, such as the mumps or the flu.ITP is more common among young women. The risk appears to be higher in people who also have other diseases in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Rarely, immune thrombocytopenia causes bleeding into the brain. This can be fatal.Someone who's pregnant with a low platelet count or who's bleeding has a greater risk of heavy bleeding during delivery. A health care provider might suggest treatment to keep the platelet count even.ITP doesn't usually affect the fetus. However, the baby's platelet count should be tested soon after birth.Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) care at Mayo ClinicConnect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in the Blood Cancers & Disorders support group on Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.157 Replies Tue, Jun 25, 2024 61 Replies Tue, Jun 25, 2024 53 Replies Mon, Jun 24, 2024 Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
