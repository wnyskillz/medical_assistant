In this case, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes are affected. When areas of the brain shrink, it's called atrophy. The atrophy caused by primary progressive aphasia mainly occurs on the left side of the brain. The areas affected are responsible for speech and language.Atrophy is associated with the presence of certain proteins in the brain. The proteins may reduce brain activity or function.Risk factors for primary progressive aphasia include:People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write. This may take anywhere from 3 to 15 years. They also have trouble understanding written and spoken language. Some people are not able to form sounds to speak, even when they still have the ability to write and comprehend language. This is called apraxia of speech.As the disease progresses, other mental skills such as memory, planning and organizing can be affected. Some people develop other symptoms such as problems with movement, balance and swallowing. With these complications, people with the disease eventually will need help with day-to-day care.People with primary progressive aphasia also can develop depression as the disease progresses. Other problems might include blunted emotions such as not showing concern, poor judgment or inappropriate social behavior.Primary progressive aphasia care at Mayo ClinicMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
