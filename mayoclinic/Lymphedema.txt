Lymphedema refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid that's usually drained through the body's lymphatic system. It most commonly affects the arms or legs, but can also occur in the chest wall, abdomen, neck and genitals.Lymph nodes are an important part of your lymphatic system. Lymphedema can be caused by cancer treatments that remove or damage your lymph nodes. Any type of problem that blocks the drainage of lymph fluid can cause lymphedema.Severe cases of lymphedema can affect the ability to move the affected limb, increase the risks of skin infections and sepsis, and can lead to skin changes and breakdown. Treatment may include compression bandages, massage, compression stockings, sequential pneumatic pumping, careful skin care and, rarely, surgery to remove swollen tissue or to create new drainage routes.The lymphatic system is part of the body's immune system, which protects against infection and disease. The lymphatic system includes the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as the tonsils and adenoids.Lymphedema is swelling in an arm or a leg. In rare circumstances, it affects both arms or both legs. It can also affect the chest wall and abdomen.Lymphedema signs and symptoms include:Signs and symptoms can range from mild to severe.

Lymphedema occurs when the lymph vessels are not able to adequately drain lymph fluid, usually from an arm or leg.The most common causes of lymphedema include:Less commonly, lymphedema results from inherited conditions in which the lymphatic system doesn't develop properly.Factors that may increase the risk of developing lymphedema include:Lymphedema complications may include:Lymphedema care at Mayo ClinicConnect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in the Heart & Blood Health support group on Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.346 Replies Sun, Jun 23, 2024 58 Replies Thu, Jun 20, 2024 106 Replies Wed, Jun 19, 2024 Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
