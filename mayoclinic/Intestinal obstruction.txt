Intestinal obstruction is a blockage that keeps food or liquid from passing through your small intestine or large intestine (colon). Causes of intestinal obstruction may include fibrous bands of tissue (adhesions) in the abdomen that form after surgery; hernias; colon cancer; certain medications; or strictures from an inflamed intestine caused by certain conditions, such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis. The small intestine and colon are parts of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat. The intestines take nutrients from the foods. What isn't absorbed by the intestines continues along the digestive tract and is passed as stool during a bowel movement. Without treatment, the blocked parts of the intestine can die, leading to serious problems. However, with prompt medical care, intestinal obstruction often can be successfully treated.Signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction include:Because of the serious complications that can develop from intestinal obstruction, seek immediate medical care if you have severe abdominal pain or other symptoms of intestinal obstruction.The most common causes of intestinal obstruction in adults are:In children, the most common cause of intestinal obstruction is telescoping of the intestine (intussusception).

In paralytic ileus, muscle or nerve problems disrupt the normal coordinated muscle contractions of the intestines, slowing or stopping the movement of food and fluid through the digestive system.Paralytic ileus can affect any part of the intestine. Causes can include:Diseases and conditions that can increase your risk of intestinal obstruction include:Untreated, intestinal obstruction can cause serious, life-threatening complications, including:Jan 20, 2021CON-XXXXXXXXMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
