Avascular necrosis is the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply. Also called osteonecrosis, it can lead to tiny breaks in the bone and cause the bone to collapse. The process usually takes months to years.A broken bone or dislocated joint can stop the blood flow to a section of bone. Avascular necrosis is also associated with long-term use of high-dose steroid medications and too much alcohol.Anyone can be affected.

Genetics combined with overuse of alcohol, certain medications and other diseases likely play a role.Risk factors for developing avascular necrosis include:Medical conditions associated with avascular necrosis include:Untreated, avascular necrosis worsens. Eventually, the bone can collapse. Avascular necrosis also causes bone to lose its smooth shape, possibly leading to severe arthritis.To reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and improve general health:May 17, 2022CON-XXXXXXXXMayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
