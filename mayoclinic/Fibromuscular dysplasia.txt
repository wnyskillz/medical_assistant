In fibromuscular dysplasia, the muscle and fiber tissues in the arteries thicken, causing the arteries to narrow. This is called stenosis. Narrowed arteries can reduce blood flow to the organs, causing organ damage. The artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery is shown here, with a "string of beads" appearance.Fibromuscular dysplasia is a condition that causes the medium-sized arteries in the body to narrow and grow larger.
