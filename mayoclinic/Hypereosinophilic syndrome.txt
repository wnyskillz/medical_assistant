Hypereosinophilic (hy-per-ee-o-SIN-o-phil-ik) syndrome (HES) is a group of blood disorders that occur when you have high numbers of eosinophils — white blood cells that play an important role in your immune system. Over time, the excess eosinophils enter various tissues, eventually damaging your organs.The most common targets are the skin, lungs, digestive tract, heart, blood and nervous system. Untreated, HES can become life-threatening.Early symptoms of HES may include fatigue, cough, breathlessness, muscle pain, rash and fever.Some varieties of hypereosinophilic syndrome tend to run in families. Other types have been associated with certain types of cancers, infections or other health problems.HES can affect anyone. But it occurs more often in men, usually between the ages of 20 and 50.Hypereosinophilic syndrome care at Mayo ClinicConnect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in the Blood Cancers & Disorders support group on Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.157 Replies Tue, Jun 25, 2024 61 Replies Tue, Jun 25, 2024 53 Replies Mon, Jun 24, 2024 Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.
